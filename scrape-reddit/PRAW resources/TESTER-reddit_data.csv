Post,15z5wr4,Very Faint Control Line (No T Line),ellenrnva,2023-08-23 14:44:23,"Hey folks. I started with a sudden sore throat at around 5pm yesterday at work and had chills and headaches when I got home at 12am. Sore throat started almost immediately as I ate a candy cane.

I‚Äôve been vaccinated and had a booster. Can‚Äôt remember if I had the second booster.

Comment,15z5wr4,Very Faint Control Line (No T Line),Kapitan2-10,2023-08-23 16:40:31,"According to manuals of tests, or at least the brands I encountered, even when the control line is faint, the test should be considered valid especially if a line on the test area (Under the T) is also visible (regardless of how faint it is). 

However in your case, since you already have early signs and symptoms of COVID, getting another retest wouldn't hurt and would absolutely confirm whether you have COVID or not. The faint line on the control may be due to dilution error (Not really sure because I rarely hear of dilution errors in this test.) Or a faulty test kit. I also suggest that if you get a retest, check the instructions on the test insert, make sure that you swab properly, and check the expiry date of the test kit. If the problem persists on the faint control line, I suggest trying another brand.

Keep safe.",1,0,

Comment,10cnar5,Vaccines and CMV reactivation,thedowcast,2023-01-15 16:02:29,"The mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines may be inducing a short-lived temporary immunosuppression allowing cytomegalovirus (CMV) to become reactivated in some people in very rare cases. This reactivation of the cytomegalovirus can in rare circumstances cause myocarditis and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and a host of other ailments. The cytomegalovirus is highly ubiquitous in nature and common in people of all ages and is the cause of chickenpox and mononucleosis in adolescents. After infection, CMV remains dormant in the body of most humans throughout their lives, but can become reactivated during immune suppression. A decreasing CMV susceptibility with men older than 45 may be the reason why rare cases of myocarditis is happening in younger people who have taken the mRNA vaccine. CMV susceptibility increases between the ages of 16-45. Treatments, medications, and even vaccines can temporarily suppress the immune system and cause CMV reactivation. This is however very rare, but should be looked into as a possible cause of rare instances of myocarditis and Guillain-Barr√© in those who have taken the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.",1,0,

Mejo nakakabother kasi nakakaaffect din sa schedules. Like nung nakaraan, may online interview ako dapat which is hinintay ko pa kasi gabi yun, and pinaghandaan, BUT naalala ko lang a day after na, 'hala! nakaligtaan ko yung interview'. That type of thing.

Suggestion lang, bukod sa phone reminders, try to journal din, or at least always have a notepad ready sa table mo na in plain view palagi para yun ang ichecheck mo everytime, then cross out kung nagawa mo na. Kasi I swear, ang lala talaga nung memory loss ko to the point na grabe na rin yung anxiety ko. So baka ganyan din yung sayo.

This might help. Printable notepad siya that I made. For personal use only. Please don't sell/use for commercial purposes. If you use it po, please tag or share it to me, so I know if nakatulong ba or useful po ba siya. Thanks!

what i did notice is, even before i was on ritalin, hindi ganito kalala yung symptoms ko. some symptoms like losing words, i never even had. and now im trying to observe if i can manage with my usual dose after full recovery or if i have to up the dosage. the doctor i'm seeing said it will get better when my overall health improves, but she didn't really specify much kung ano gagawin haha.  


i do know other people who aren't taking meds but have adhd; some friends, my brother, and my cousin. my cousin in particular has a more severe case pero sabi niya he's doing really well without it so di na siya gagastos. so yeah, just sharing na it's different for everyone.

Watson's has for 350pesos, they also have online delivery but if within MM, it takes 2-4 days to arrive. You can check via Grab Mart for same day delivery or nearest pharmacy (you can call them if you can't go out)

Get your dad tested then observe the symptoms if it'll get worse. There are days when he'll feel ok, but it comes in waves so fever might come back later within the day. If manageable symptoms, get tested again after 5 days from the onset of symptoms to check if negative. If symptoms aren't that mild, wait until no fever for 24 hours then get yourself tested if negative.

And yes, if you are staying with him, you need to quarantine as well for a week until both of you are negative. If there's no one else to help you out and you need to pick up something, make sure you are alone in a vehicle and keep your mask on if you can't help but interact with people. Keep interactions very short. Wash your hands all the time also. Although I highly suggest to isolate yourself pa din at home.

Most common symptoms are intermittent fever (mine was nocturnal) , body malaises, weaknesses, loss of taste , indigestion (uncommon) , loose bowel movement (uncommon), breathing problems (mild or avobe) , insomnia ( uncommon). Check the newer variants for more symptoms.

For your dad probably go for 10 days. For you incubation period carries from 2 - 9 days it might be asymptomatic at first in your case so just add the number of days from your asymptomatic period to isolation. But check with medical experts like internal medicine, virologist or similar specialization. Even tho I'm a nurse grad I'm not an expert in the matter also take note if your dad has any underlying illnesses that can multiply the risk of complications.

2. Yes, you should ***quarantine*** for 5 days. This could be less because the Omnicron variant has a shorter incubation period (2-3d) versus the earlier strains (4-5d) but the 5-day rule still applies because if you *do* have it, you're highly contagious 1-2 days *before* symptoms appear and 2-3 days after symptoms show up

Just know that coughing (after 5 days has passed) is ***not*** a symptom. It's simply the result of the ""aftermath"" of COVID wherein he's removing mucus from his lungs due to the infection. He is already non-contagious by then so don't be a stranger.",2,0,

Isolate.  

Contrary to popular beliefs, viruses are to be shared. Now you got covid, isolate.  I don't get it.  What changed? Flu is deadly. Colds develope into upper respiratory syndrome and can kill you so, go to work. I got nearly 70 years of life to prove it.  I never understood it though.  

So now you got a cold,  paid sick day .  No. Refer above. Go to work and share it.

Sorry folks, I'm just sick and tired of it. If you're sick, stay home and isolate. It's simply. 

If you're the type that just needs to know, plan ahead and get your testing materials before your sick. It won't heal you, but then you'll be first in line for experimental medications and tubes. 

I've had four injections for covid and probably 60 or more lifetime flu shots.  Just got over a 101 fever,  aches and pain, painful cough, sore throat, headache, nothing taste right, smell was fine, low energy, couldn't sleep. I didn't test. I just isolated.  

Now, had I gone to the hospital, I would have had many visitors, Drs., nurses, etc and I bet a live in roommate or two. Let's see,  maybe I had the flu and my hospital roommate had covid or visa versa. Then we complicate each other's recovery. 

Stay home and isolate.  Best cure is a hot bowl of Filipine tangy, sour, chicken soup from the masarap sampalik tamarind tree.  Sinigang  Any version. Add spice to help clear out the phlegm.

You do know the spike protein lasts long in the body and can cause some serious side effects, depending on where they linger, right? The CDC removed a statement in their website that says the spike protein your cells create because of the mRNA doesn't last long in the body, because they just found out that they actually do last long. Studies have found they cause a myriad of health problems. What is the efficacy of these shots on the latest prevalent omicron variant? Is there a breakdown of hospitalization and death rates per population number in the PH based on age and vaccination status? Do you know the shots are still based on the original wuhan strain and does not specifically target omicron? How long before the efficacy tapers off? Why do we have negative efficacy in some areas in other countries for vaccinated and boosted individuals? Do you know that there are warnings for increased risk for myocarditis for men under 40 taking these shots, found on the vaccine inserts themselves? Do the shots stop the spread? No? Do they at least slow the spread? By how much? What's the number? These are just some questions people need the answers to before deciding on their own whether or not to take the shots. It's just simple risk to benefit analysis. It's ridiculous and anti-science to follow a one size fits all approach in medicine. If you don't know the answers to the questions above, how can you recommend EVERYONE eligible for the shots take them? Do you even know that people can and do die from taking the shots as well?

Nakita nila na student ako and said na hindi daw sila nagbibigay ng vaxx unless A1 or A2. Which I tried to reason out na A1 ako since I'm a nursing student and naka-state naman yun sa vaxx card at qr code ko. I also told them na  my school will be conducting clinical rotations by next week so I need that 2nd shot.

Comment,w5uq8b,Comorbidity vs Immunocompromised for A3 second booster,Curious-Passerby495,2022-07-23 06:14:38,"Those who are immunocompromised are a subset of A3. If you were originally A3, you are still A3. It's just that 2nd boosters have only been opened to the immunocompromised subset. What DOH can do is limited by the authorization/product registration granted by the FDA to the vaccines plus the recommendation of the HTAC.

Currently, 2nd boosters are not yet authorized by the FDA for the general adult population. FDA authorization is something that the company manufacturing/distributing the product applies for. Though nothing is stopping the DOH from applying for authorization on its own (which is what it did with the Sinopharm vaccines adminstered to Du30).

Currently in the US, 2nd boosters (mRNA vaccines only) are authorized/recommended only for those older than 50 years old, and those at least 12 years old AND with immunocompromising conditions.

Though, more than demanding that 2nd boosters be opened to more groups, it is more imperative to demand from government diversified action, including crafting and enforcing ventilation/indoor air quality standards (like we do with drinking water), improving/enabling masking practices, strengthening surveillance. Also, enabling/facilitating cultural change in the way we treat illnesses as something we just ignore/power through, not for ourselves but for the sake of people we may come in contact with who may actually be at high risk of severe disease, disability and death from COVID-19

A vaccine-centric approach did not prevent the emergence of new variants. A booster-centric approach will fail similarly.",9,0,

Comment,w5uq8b,Comorbidity vs Immunocompromised for A3 second booster,Not_ready_to_say_hi,2022-07-23 06:47:29,"Sir/Maam, thank you for clarifying what the A3 category  is as I wasn't aware of the current events you mentioned in your 1st to 3rd paragraphs. I do somewhat concur with the diversification of healthcare interventions on a marco level. Unfortunately, on a macro level and perhaps is what is generally seen, people aren't wearing masks anymore (whether indoors or in crowdes areas), more in person events are happening, and there is general complacency with returning to a bubble-type or ""lockdown""-like mandate for places like NCR.

I cannot blame those who want the booster as it does prevent against Omicron and subvariants (e.g. ""There is a third‚Äîand likely most important‚Äîquestion that has to do with how protective the¬†existing vaccines¬†will be against the new variant, says Dr. Murray. Experts are saying that the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants seem to have the ability to elude (meaning evade) some of the antibodies produced after vaccinations and infections, including those caused by some Omicron subvariants."") Unfortunately, it seems getting a booster for your immediate family seems to be the single, ""convenient"" solution to protection. COVID hospitalization is expensive, and people (not just Filipinos) want to pretend the pandemic is no longer a thing. 

Madami pa akong gustong sabihin pero baka masyadong TL;DR na. Honestly, I'm worried for the next months. Anyways, stay safe all. Do what you can and demand what you should.

I was ushered in the line and then when I got to the end of the queue, the head usher there said they were only accepting priority 1/A./ Senior/ PWC  I literally lined up for over 4 hours and they turned me away when it was my turn. 


Tapos, I asked them bakit ganon? Why was I scheduled then when I signed up? Sabi ng kuya, hindi ko alam. 


Tapos, sabi ko, "" ok, then bakit hindi niyo agad sinabi sa mga ushers sa unang pila pa lang""


Sabi niya, ""May mga nag-complain na nga po.""


End of conversation. I kept asking more but he literally physically turns away because he doesn't know how to answer.



They literally can't do their jobs right. QC sucks. Sayang tax money ko sa kanila grabe. If I had the option to take my money back, sa kanila ko kukunin.

Some people also have that nasty habit of picking their nose boogers and wiping them off at walls, handrails on staircases, bus seats and others to name a few. I saw a video on of a group of high school kids doing this, flicking their nose boogers at each other, very disgusting and uncivilized like something Monkeys and baboons would do in the wild. You never know who you encounter and meet on your daily routine. I understand kindness and being nice however people have to know of having a habit of washing hands and feet, arms with clean soap and water, using a  deodorant, perfume/cologne and using a bit of hygienic alcohol hand spray for good measure to avoid spreading disease, viruses and bacteria.

Not active cases, not new cases, not recovered cases, just cases.

This means to me, there are only +655 cases in the Philippines.

I guess the + symbol might mean a gain of cases, but +655 is way above the daily average. Yet the total active cases is about 50,000 with a 7 day average of under 500.

We can compute that for the USA and other longer lived populations with the CDC numbers:

To Xmas 2020 the total deaths ('covid involved' column, to be conservwtive) is 380k:

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#SexAndAge

And the estimate infected population to Xmas 2020 was 83million (using a web archive snapshot):

https://web.archive.org/web/20210125105905/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html

So the IFR was 0.4%


In the UK the average age of death before covid was 81.4 (UK office of national statistics):

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/datasets/averageageatdeathbysexuk

And the average age of covid death is 80.4:

https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/averageageofthosewhohaddiedwithcovid19

So the question is was it justified to adopt China-lockdown, which was an experiment, instead of the WHO's carefully worked out pandemic policy that had a more balanced approach?

Especially when you consider who was dying:

*""Among 4,899,447 hospitalized adults in PHD-SR, 540,667 (11.0%) were patients with COVID-19, of whom 94.9% had at least 1 underlying medical condition. Essential hypertension (50.4%), disorders of lipid metabolism (49.4%), and obesity (33.0%) were the most common. The strongest risk factors for death were obesity (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.27‚Äì1.33), anxiety and fear-related disorders (aRR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.25‚Äì1.31), and diabetes with complication""* https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2021/21_0123.htm

Unfortunately, the DOH does not disclose the number of fatalities according to vaccination status, let alone the mortality rate. As for the spikes in additional deaths, please take note that the date of report of death is not the same as the date of actual death. There are instances wherein it takes weeks before a death is confirmed to be related to COVID-19, hence there is a latency.

As for the positivity rate, there are three main reasons as to why it's low recently:

* fewer tests conducted - less LGUs are requiring negative tests for travel
* virus finding fewer hosts - the SARS-CoV-2 virus is having difficulty on finding more people to infect
* testing is still expensive - there are some testing centers who conduct free testing, but they're limited",2,0,

But according to study from WHO and several sources 3months can be sufficient.

This is because covid vaccine is T-RNA and it's just newly discovered technology around 2012 but long term study got finished by 2016 or 2018 irrc.

Overtime your boosted immunity gets weaker to a certain factor but not totally zero. It will stop at a certain base like 70% or something (check who guidelines for this or certified scientific journals regarding vaccine)

Do keep in mind the covid virus mutates. Like any virus for example flu overtime had around 8million+ strains and is lethal during Abraham's to Christ even by the crusade era. So in terms of mutation there will be stronger and more fatal variants than other. There will be more specialized in the spread and pray to whoever god you worship that the super spreader don't mix with the highly fatal combined with the drug resistant variant like in plague.inc

Now regarding to vaccine some vaccines like moderna requires 15 people to share one bottle because one bottle has a capacity to vaccinate that amount of people. And if the vaccine is thawed is will be rendered useless after exposure to certain temperature for a time. To avoid waste they need fifteen people. Now some vaccines has a quantity that's to be divided like 2 or 5 and so on. Because that's how it was marketed. For cost efficiency and storage as well. (Remember it is made during crisis. They need it to be given to as many people as needed)

Now about vaccine efficacy. They say you are protected to 6months as optimum and others may start to decline but just like I said it depends on they vaccine type so research WHO data that is posted. And pls make sure it's legit not some ""marites vaccine expert kuno""

About the vaccine. Some supply are more scarce than others. Some have better sync ratio than others if combined. Some are more effective with certain variant than others.

Example: for me I had primary and secondary dose of sinovac and choose moderna with known adverse reactions and aggressive side effects. Because it's good with such sync-ratio and I wanted more delta variant protection.

As a non practicing nurse with another member in the family who is a front liner. This is what I wanted and even had 2nd and 3rd opinion from doctors and certified individuals (not some marites expert kuno) 
Always know the pros and cons. Check for short term and long term goal. 

Example: is the week long body malaise a good trade off for added resistance to delta variant. What is the clinical known side effects, is something being produced from replicated cells of abortus babies ok for your moral compass or faith. How much do you value your families life. How much can you spend in hospitalizations like the ICU or can you buy a full set of remdizivir of around 8k pesos per dose and it needs a lot. (Bathala na ba si batman?) Mentality , are you with old people or those with compromised health conditions, how about comorbidity?
What are your priority (single. And it means all other things are secondary that can be disposed or thrown in the gutter) if forced to make a choice.

Now think what's best for you , and how or why you want this. Then ask experts of this is logical. Then make a choice.

Do keep in mind they will prioritized scheduled second dose for seniors. Then those with comorbidity. Even if there are others asking. Why? Because those are the top two priorities.

Now: this are my opinion as a nurse. And with someone who has a doctor within the family. As well as a good circle of aquatinted people in the medical field. But if you want hyper specialized data it must be a vaccine focused specialization of the endocrine system or immunology field. Do keep in mind that those are more rarer than drawing 10ssr rare gacha cards in a draw ten banner. Technically.00001% amongst the global population. (Yes we may not have sufficient facilities to train them here in our back water country)

Second: research are updated frequently. Specially if it's a newly developed technology. Covid vaccine has no long term study of 40+ years yet. Some effects can show a long time before it takes place like nicotine or asbestos. But is it worth taking the risk of being hospitalized and getting a bill of 300+k for just  3+ days? And that is an understatement if you are confined to the ICU.

Third: some medical terms are too complex to be understood easily and can be misinterpreted if you are not too careful. This also means knowing too little makes you brave and charge a minefield. Blowing yourself to smithereens is just a side note.

Last: always take things with a grain of salt and doubt. (Malay mo binubulshit lang kita) a second opinion from people who knows the ups and downs always help. This can also provide input in things I missed or things needed with clarification.

Second, what do you think about it? Do you want to have your kids or young relatives vaccinated?

Personally, my sister and mother decided not to vaccinate my niece. I understand their decision, because the child (9 y/o) rarely goes out, and only goes out with family (almost all vaccinated). Also vaccinating that child will be hard, if she does not want, she can't be easily fooled or forced to. Also best to improve vaccination among the free thinking adults and adolescents. Once she reaches 12 or adolescence, I'd ask her myself and hope she gives her consent.",1,0,

Comment,smha1i,Sharing and Discussion: Kids 5 to 11 Years Old Can Now Get Their Vax at SM | SM Supermalls,cereseluna,2022-02-07 08:57:24,"Aside from Covid vaccine being a relatively new vaccine so people naturally have some concerns on its effectiveness and safety esp. for children, some people are anti-vaccine due to fake news and false beliefs.

In the Philippines, we had this Dengvaxia dengue vaccine fiasco where children developed severe reactions, some even died supposedly because of the new vaccine.

https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/dangvaxia-philippines/

My family as a whole are not antivaxxers, we are fully vaccinated. Only our father (we could not force him, afraid that vaccine may exacerbate his weak lungs and body), and our niece aren't... the grandma and mom think she's too young to be subjected to a (still) experimental  / new vaccine. Another reason is the effort, if the child does not want to go or even get vaccinated, wasted effort. She rarely goes out. Also we have to trick her into bringing her to Metro Manila because the vaccination in our municipality is just bad that it's still stuck to adults.",3,0,

These past few days, it's becoming more frequent that my lungs feels tight (idk how do i explain this). It gets worse whenever I get scared because my heart beats so fast that sometimes my chest feels tight and i think of dying immiduately. Nonetheless, it gets away after a few minutes especially when I'm distracted. I am 20 y/o and I had a history of asthma during childhood. Should I consider it normal which will go away eventually, given that I'm able to manage it or should it still be something to worry about?  What should I do when I experience it again?

\- seek help ASAP. this sounds like cardiovascular involvement and may have long term complications if you ""wait for it to disappear or subside"". Anything that happens to your lungs (like difficulty of breathing) strains your heart. I've had 3-4 friends around 30-40 years of age die in the last year because of ""cardiac arrest"".

It happens very rare and some people I used to work as a nurse told me that this happens. Not ofthen or uncommon but it's like the Super rare chances you get for gacha pulls.

Now there is also timing and ensuring you have enough viral population in that locality to be smeared when testing. Keep in mind gargling antibacterial mouth washes clears some of those virus if you have very few of them to begin with. And yes alcohol is antiseptic. Those 80proof they are the same as mouthwash in alcohol percentage or close.

When viruses replicate, they replicate their genetic material and use that as a template to make the virus proteins. They then assemble all the pieces to make the whole virus.

Since antigen tests detect the virus proteins, some virus proteins may still be present (antigen positive) but the virus is not anymore actively replicating its genetic material (PCR negative).

A more simple explanation is that the result of the antigen test was merely a false positive. Or the swab was done poorly.",1,0,

RAT on the other hand is sensitive pero less specific, meaning a negative result does not mean sure negative, and a positive result is good enough.

Also, the vaccine's efficacy wanes after 6-8 months, and for Omicron, it's as short as 10 weeks. Each subsequent booster brings forth more chances for adverse effects, such as Bell's Palsy, infertility, pericarditis, paralysis, and even death, in addition to Myocarditis.

They are required to not let you in the door if you are close contact, suspect, probable, or confirmed case. You need to complete the required isolation period.

They can only urge employers to give paid leaves but not require it. That would require for a law to pass.

There are small businesses that closed for a few days kasi lahat sila for quarantine. If wala na nga silang kita, magbabayad pa ng renta and utilities, tapos magbabayad pa ng tao? Baka magsara na lang sila niyan. Instead na makatulong, mawalan pa ng trabaho tao.

They would need to pass a law to set up a mechanism to help the small businesses to keep afloat while giving this benefit. However, bakit nila gagawin yun kung may SSS na naka-set up para tulungan sila?

Businesses should be thought how to help their employees claim the sickness benefit instead.

Runny nose, Headache, Sneezing, Persistent cough, Sore throat, Chills.

As reported, one unique symptom of omicron someone may experience is NIGHT SWEATS. Others may also experience a scratchy throat. Hindi common ang pagkawala ng panlasa at pang amoy sa omicron.

From this list you can somehow deduce if you had omicron, based din kay Doc Willie Ong.

Comment,s6u8u0,How long did you fully recover from the omicron variant?,The_Orange_Ranger,2022-01-19 02:48:51,"Noong nagsimula yung symptoms, chills lang at I slight fever sa gabi(tapos pagpapawisan ka dahil sa chills/fever). Mga tatlong gabi lang siguro ito. Hindi ko alam noong first day kung dahil lang malamig ang weather. Isinabay na ako ng family members ko na pina-swab test, at ayun positive nga. Not sure kung omicron kasi hindi naman ata kasama yung genome sequencing sa swab test para malaman yung variant. Day 2 noong medyo may sore throat. Pero nawala din eventually. May diarrhea sa day 2-3/4 ata. Pero lagpas noon, wala na yung chills, diarrhea, at sore throat. Nakuha siguro sa lozenges, saka yung anti-diarrhea. Day 5-day 10+, inuubo na lang minsan. Pero nawawala kapag nag-inhaler ako at uminom ng gamot tulad ng Montelukast(although hindi ko alam kung dahil sa Covid ba o sa allergic rhinitis ko).  


Parang yung worse part ng Covid yung first 3 days. Tapos after nun, parang common na ubo na lang, Although until now, nasa isolation pa rin ako para lang makasiguro na hindi na ako infectious.   


Sa ibang family members naman, fever, mabigat ang pakiramdam, ubo at sipon. May chills din yung iba noong simula.  


I am not sure, pero mukhang nakatulong naman siguro yung vaccine booster. Noong sinabing pwede na magpa-booster kapag within 3 months kumuha na agad kami last December bago tumaas yung cases. So bale, halos lahat dito sa bahay naka-3 dose ng AstraZeneca.",4,0,

To clarify, night sweats appear to be the distinguishing symptom of omicron, that's according to many news articles published.

If we are to investigate Sars cov2's close cousin which is the influenza virus, you know that new vaccines are issued yearly for different strains.

Omicron is similar to being a different *strain*, although it is less evolved to be considered one, hence it still a variant- this is scientific and virology nitty gritty that I am not confident enough to explain properly. Sarscov also doesnt evolve as fast as the flu. 

Point is, if our theory (and perhaps, proven by the emergence of different variants over the past year) is that Covid19 is continually evolving, then the current generation of vaccines need to be updated or tailor made to the specific strain or variant of the time-period. So the next vaccines should be Omicron based, and not just a continuation of  boosters. Take note that boosters will eventually have a lesser marginal benefit per shot as well.",3,0,

This can make those nasal vaccines viable.

I am actually boosted and infected w covid now. It  does feel like a bad cold and as we know, there is no vaccine for a cold, which is actually a type of corona virus as well

But really, as long as there are vaccines that can neutralize the spike protein (AZ, mRNA), or even the whole ""core"" of the virus (Sinovac, Sinopharm, Covaxin), then we can perhaps manufacture vaccines that help prevent transmission dowm the line.

That's true that immunity weakens over time. But if you either had a jab, or just recovered from infection, you'll have an increased amount of antibodies for about three months. But we all know that Omicron has learned to bypass antibodies. And breakthrough infections and reinfections are expected. Hopefully, T-cells will be the key for long-term immunity.

Like it or not, the virus mutated to adapt itself against the vaccine. In hindsight, we could wonder if it was better not to have made a vaccine in the first place. And battle against the pandemic with pure natural immunity. Look at the Spanish flu, it never really went away but instead mutated itself into a weaker variant that became harmless over the years.",2,0,
Comment,s5z7xk,"""4th Covid19 dose may only be available for the immuno-compromised"" Thoughts?",Sad-Weekend8849,2022-01-22 03:20:55,"I like to think that Omicron can frequently bypass vaccine protection because previous variants replicated significantly in the blood and deep lung tissues. Hence antibodies and immuno-cells are concentrated there.  
However because Omicron mostly replicates in the upper respiratory tract, there weren't many antibodies to effectively and readily deal with them.  


Yeah, it's fascinating that the Spanish Flu is still floating around. What's even more interesting is that people who got infected by the Spanish flu and survived still had neutralizing antibodies more than 9 decades after.

Alam ko may mga barangay na may transpo for vaccination centers, testing centers, and public hospitals.  Siguro implement this plan for all barangays  - a way to promote vaccination din. Tapos damihan na lang din mga sanitation centers and regulations to avoid the spread. kahit naman kasi vaccinated, pwede pa rin makahawa ng ibang tao.

Doctors/cardiologists here in my province thought it was just anxiety. But last october i finally had the chance to go back to manila and decided to see a cardiologist cause i still had shortness of breath and palpitations back then. He advised me to get cardiac mri and it was the only test that detected it. My cardiologist said medyo natamaan lang ng slight one of the arteries but it was already healing when it was detected.

My workmate ako na taga-Manda na nagsabi pwede mag walk-in. It worked for them sa Starmall Shaw vaccination site. I thought applicable sa iba so nag-try ako pumila sa Edsa Shang vaccination site one time. Pagdating ko, may 2 pila: 1 for those na naka-receive ng text from MandaVax na scheduled sila for that day and another 1 for those na gusto mag walk-in. Pumila ako sa ""walk-in"" kaso di nila makita name ko sa listahan nila. May iba din na nauna sa akin na wala rin sa listahan so umalis na lang ako and pumunta sa Megamall vaccination site kasi meron din booster shot dun the same day.

Sa Mega naman, strictly no walk-ins and need na may schedule ka talaga para makakuha ka ng booster. Buti nakita ko agad before ako pumila.

Sadly walang schedule sa Starmall Shaw nung araw na yun so umuwi na lang akong sawi.

What I did next is to submit a photocopy of my vaccination card sa barangay para magkaroon ako ng sure sched sa booster kesa umasa sa walk-in. Currently waiting if mapapasama ako next week kasi 30 slots lang per day ang available for our barangay and mukhang madami pa ung backlog nila. I would suggest you coordinate with your barangay and submit your details para mapalista.

P.S. We also had the same problem in getting our 1st and 2nd dose,  hintay kami ng hintay na mag-txt si MandaVax for the sched pero wala. Nung nagpasa kami sa barangay ng names namin,  after a few days nagka-schedule na agad kami. Ganun ata talaga dito sa Manda, kelangan mag-palista sa barangay on top of registering sa MandaVax.

Follow the health protocols. Social distancing, wear a mask properly, and always bring hand sanitizer or alcohol for disinfection.

In regards to 'diarrhea' perhaps it may cause other reasons though diarrhea is one of the symptoms of coronavirus infection. For you to clear your mind, it's better to consult your doctor.

Other reasons for diarrhea:

* Food poisoning
* Medications
* Poor absorption

etc.

As early as 2020, the case database of the Department of Health is constantly being validated for any errors in the data. Should there be one, it will be removed from the system. 

There can be multiple reasons as to why this is happening, but the most evident one is that there are duplicates on some cases. Once they are removed from the system, they are called as ‚Äúpurged cases.‚Äù Because of this, there is the ‚Äògross‚Äô increase (what the DOH reports) and the ‚Äònet‚Äô increase (after all purged cases and backlogs have been checked).

As for the deaths and recoveries, there are what we call as cases that have changed status, like a deceased case whieh was wrongly tagged as a recovered case. Those kinds of cases are also being checked to get the net increases in deaths and recoveries.",3,0,

My father tested positive Jan.10, he had RTPCR on Jan.7 and had fever and was coughing on Jan.6. My mother also got tested, which is negative. But now she is also showing symptoms.

I'm not sure if I also caught Covid or only experiencing side-effects of the booster. If I do have Covid, will there be an issue with the booster?

Update: Just got tested. Results will be available within 2 to 4 days pa.

Update 2: Got my results na, and positive. üòû",12,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus_PH/comments/s0pj1z/booster_sideeffects_or_covid/
Comment,s0pj1z,Booster side-effects or Covid?,Infernalknights,2022-01-10 20:48:39,"Seek medical EXPERTS advice and second opinion. Preferably whose Internal med specialist or those who work for respiratory tract infection.

I can only provide so little as a nurse.

I was infected once by my mother that's a frontliner (she's a doctor) this was the normal covid back in April. My results only showed positive after 8 days and she was positive only after 2+1/2 weeks some covid can show false negative if you have no particular symptoms yet. Specially if it's not in the upper respiratory tract (virus colonies) , symptoms may vary with each variant so please check additional details. You may have body malaise, slightly afebrile ( meaning fever like temperature in a definite time frame or erratic ) [you can have fever as your bodies natural reaction to foreign infection by heating your body temp. This is exhausting to the cells and use a lot of energy , why you will have muscle pains and body malaise and dehydration] , diarrhea or wet watery stools can persist , sore throat and flu like reactions. But not limited to these symptoms. Loss for taste or appetite may persist for days or weeks. Tachycardia and shortness of breath ( this is very important because you might need intubation for this if going for a grinding halt in breath)

Now about the vaccine side effects. It's similar to most virus side effects. But the sight of injection can also be painful from a slight discomfort to a bit tense or slightly irritated. But should not be to a point of great or severe pain. Can also cause blood clotting (severe importance if you show this symptoms ) , tenderness of the site of injection might be for a few days but should be subsiding and not alleviating.

Now there are other variant specific symptoms or complications that I'm not fully aware.
This is where you get filled in by EXPERTS. (Hindi ung nagmamarunong) and probably go for doctors from hospitals that's public trained in very high number of cases for more experience.

Take this with a grain of salt, and a lot of doubt. Malay mo binubulshit lang kita. And experts can probably give you a better second opinion.

Ps: if exposed ka and Wala ka pa symptoms it will not be 100% infected ka. Ng nag quarantine ung mother ko sa Bahay Bago sya sinundo ng ambulance to RITM mag katabi kami ng father ko na 80+ YO. nag positive ako after 2 weeks. And false negative ako ng first week. May lumabas na symptoms the week after and on the second week dun ako n positive. Pero highly asymptomatic ako. 36.8¬∞c or slightly afebrile since 38¬∞c ung fever. Nocturnal only. Loss of appetite. Working taste buds except when I'm afebrile. Slightly affected reaction time and motor functions. And a more weakened body that needed more rest.

Hindi na infect father ko. Salamat n lang.

Do keep in mind if may prob ka sa heart or diabetes ung complications ng covid ung nakakapagod Sayo.
It may In term cause more things.

Look for true Experts advice. Ung Hindi nagkukunwari. And what I might be saying might not be enough regarding updates. Sabmga medical journals and recent discoveries.",6,0,

Keep in mind. Do drink multivitamins with zink. It helped me a lot. But check for other meds that this will have contraindications with experts.

If symptoms are asymptomatic to light or mild. Do gargle with lukewarm water of about 230ml and 1 tbs of salt water. Normally I also add del Monte cane vinegar for better effects. Mouthwash can also do the trick but it costs.

Always check oxygen blood saturation and vital signs. If may hypertension or prob sa heart or diabetes napaka complicated ng covid. 

Di ako nananakot pero 3 doctors n na Kilala ko personal na may hypertension , (sumalangit nawa Sila).. one of those ung doctor k mismo.

Sabi nila mild lang ung omicron pero ung secondary illness mo more or less tatapos Sayo pag di k maingat. If delta yan be vigilant.

Pwedeng nocturnal lumabas symptoms Nyan. And panahon din to ng flu at pneumonia so pwede din umangkas unnsa covid.

Always check if maayos ung bronchial capacity mo by blowing the fire from a candlestick or two without heavy strain. Lalong Lalo na pag may difficulty of breathing.

Also check with experts advice for new updates of dos and don't.

I hope you and anyone in your household recovers. Been there and done those things.  It will be difficult and a struggle to a crawl if thongs go against your way. But being prepared with information , determination , resources and modern medical science should fix things, then there is your faith and also placebo. Roll your cards properly.

Post,rx5ws1,Booster Side-Effects: Moderna,toyangthecreator,2022-01-06 04:48:54,"I'm 19F and just got my Moderna booster shot last January 4. So far, I have pain in injection site AND chest pain/difficulty breathing.

I'm extra worried about the chest pain dahil naranasan ko lang ito noong nagkaCOVID ako last March-April 2021. Pero never ko 'to naramdaman noong nagpaCOVID vaccine ako (yung 2 doses ko, Sinovac). Also read that chest pain is more prevalent in males than female and is a rare side effect to get when you get any mRNA COVID vaccine. (pero mas malaki daw ang chances kapag Moderna)

Worried lang din ako na I might have contracted COVID and wondering if I need to isolate since I live with 2 seniors and 2 kids.

Anyone else experienced chest pain/difficulty breathing due to Moderna booster specifically? Or any other useful info? Kumusta side effects ng booster shot mo?

Yes, that's what puzzles my brother's pulmonologist too. She said PTB is a chronic case - meaning it develops over a long time. Which means, the rest of us at home should have already been infected but we all tested negative except for my brother. 

It is for this reason why she couldn't make any conclusive diagnosis - whether my brother's case is indeed PTB or Koch's pneumonia - and why she is remotely considering that it a side effect of Moderna since there is not a lot of clinical data about it since it is new vaccine type called mRNA unlike other vaccines which usually has years of clinical research and tests before they are commercialized.",1,0,

Now if your KN95 is legit but cannot fit your face properly for some reason, then a tight pitta mask *over* your KN95 mask may be beneficial to create a better fit. That is pretty much the only use for a pitta mask - to improve fit, but most of the time, it's not needed. Wearing it under a KN95 will only create leaks, which would not exist if the KN95 directly touches your skin.

They do put it online though to gather some comments and feedbacks prior to the peer review as you can imagine the study is still being refined.

After Christmas, here comes the lockdown. Maybe not literally. Covid is not contained. It got better because of, what reason? We will be back up to 10k or more a day soon. I don't believe covid positives ever reached the low levels reported during the Christmas season. But in case it did, how long did it take to go from 3,600 a day to the reported levels. Just a couple of days. I bet this will last for months.

There is a woman possibly be charged with not reporting her desease. Not the case. She reported to mandatory quarantine quarters and took the test for covid. That's reporting. She gave her DNA. Was that on the 22nd. Found positive on the 27th. Really, that long? Only a thousand or so cases per day. And, the testing site took 6 days to reveal her positive.

She may be guilty of bribing and leaving a quanteed facility without properly being cleared, but not of reporting a desease she didn't know she had. And the test was put on the back burner.

If this desease is so bad and what she did so terrible, then testing should have been such a priority the results should have been made available earlier.

My God, she could have died of covid before her results were made known.

6 days to get results. Who didn't report?",1,0,

Sakto konti lang tao. The doctor there asked me a bunch of questions, pero nagulat ako when she asked ""Uminom ka ba kagabi?""
Sabi ko I had a bottle of beer (san mig light) last night, then she said firmly that I could not get my booster bec of that.
So I tried to protest, asking her of any guidelines or reference or scientific basis for that, but she just said baka daw maospital ako or ma-ER. 

Anyone familiar with this issue? I tried googling it but all I could find were articles saying it's okay to drink before/after the vaccine.

Anyway, lumipat lang ako ng vax site in Caloocan, 2 km away and the doctor there didn't even ask me if I had a drink the day before. So I had my Moderna booster shot afterwards (Yay!).",13,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus_PH/comments/rmlzo5/cant_get_covid_booster_vaccine_because_i_had_beer/

As far as I know, there are no existing guidelines regarding the relationship between alcohol consumption and COVID-19 vaccines. And based on the mechanism of action of the vaccines and the metabolism of alcohol, I don't think there is a direct relationship with each other.

However, alcohol may impair the immune response based on its metabolic pathways. So far, its not that significant to dampen the effects of the vaccine. Just don't go to the vaccination centers drunk or tipsy to be safe and sure na mababakunahan kayo.",15,0,

Comment,rl2waa,Any articles/studies regarding the effectiveness of an AstraZeneca BOOSTER against Omicron?,Unknown,2021-12-21 01:50:21,"There is some opinion that AZ booster for an AZ ""primary series"" in general, is NOT a good choice. Sorry I can't link you any studies, but I was in a lecture before that **in theory**, using a viral vector vaccine as booster can be nulified by the antibodies generated from the prior viral vector course.

Remember that AZ uses a modified adenovirus, so once a new adenovirus vaccine comes in from your booster, the older antibodies fight and react against this. This is the reason why our DOH PREFERS Pfizer and Moderna (mRNA) or even Sinovac as a booster, due to the difference in platform.

Same as for the J and J vaccine. Again these are all theoretical. One would surely be more secure with a Pfizer  booster, since these have precedent studies in Canada, among others.

AGAIN, THIS IS THEORETICAL. There are no widespread booster studies yet re Omicron since it is fairly new. The study that Pfizer booster helps in protection against it was done inside a lab- in short, a petri dish with some very early data coming from South Africa, a country that mostly use AZ, and Pfizer, but nothing definitive yet.

1.) IF your OG vax was Janssen:
  

  
Moderna booster = 76x antibodies
  

  
Pfizer booster = 35x antibodies
  

  
Janssen = 4x antibodies
  

  
2.) IF your vax OG was Pfizer:
  

  
Moderna booster = 32x antibodies
  

  
Pfizer booster = 20x
  

  
Janssen booster = 13x
  

  
3.) IF your OG vax was Moderna :
  

  
Pfizer booster = 11x antibodies
  

  
Moderna booster = 10x
  

  
Janssen booster = 6x
  

  
mRNA-made vaccines are really the gold standard.
  

  
If hindi avail ang mRNA (and kung hindi nga ito nag-exist), it would be best to use ""vector-type"" vaccines like Aztra and Janssen. FUN FACT: The 1st ever vaccine made in the history of mankind was a vector-type, a vaccine concocted using cowpox virus to fight the smallpox; thus, its the name ""vaccine"" from the word ""vaca"" which means ""cow"" (baka).

Post,rkysh4,Serious question! Has anyone associated any specific smells that someone with corona may carry?,CcJenson,2021-12-20 22:21:03,"Serious question! So quick setup for my question of where I'm at right now...

I've been locked up in my apartment for the past 10 days because I had corona. I stayed in here and went from kinda sick, to pretty damn sick, to getting way better and I'm basically fine now minus the looming symptoms of no taste or smell and the weird headiness feeling. It's only been today that in getting little sparks of taste and even smaller sparks of smell. So thats where I'm at!

So I think I can't smell anything and take the trash out to the dumpster and come back and as soon as I open my door im hit with a very specific smell that I can't explain any other way except a weird hospital / nursing home / idek because I've never smelt anything like it before. Definitely smelled sickly. Disclaimer: it was definitely not a BO type smell, I've smelt that before, belive me lol I've forced myself to shower every morning (even if that's all I got out of bed for that day) and I even washed my bedding 2 days ago because I was laid up pretty good for like 4 or 5 days straight, so after I wasn't so sick I changed and washed bedding. So it's neither of those things. I just can't get over how specific and unique it was...it for sure didn't smell Goooood lol but it wasn't like a horrible rotting or disgustingly dirty human smell either. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT??! Lol it's just me in my apartment so idk...

It has got to be something on or with me somehow because I finelly left my apartment today and got into the car. Didn't notice any foreign smell at all...I was in my car about 20 or so minutes and then I was outside away from it for like 15 minutes..... Got back in the car...SAME SMELL!!! I wasn't even thinking about it, it caught me so off guard. Other people HAVE to know something about this lol please let me know what you guys think. 

I've tried searching for it and only found like a small few thread's about it. It's tough cause ""loss of SMELL/SCENT"" is so popular and clogs my searching. It is definitely not a popular typic, anyway, to say the least. So please, do I like freaking stink?? Lol let me know!

The map shows regional addresses.,mesorta,2021-12-15 09:25:16,"Nice regional map. 1 to 5 cases = pink. No pink on this regional map. I guess there is no quarantining because Manila should be pink with 2 cases. How do you let returning or visiting people travel to other areas without a negative test?

You required a negative test days before departure from that other country. You tested again in Manila. You did right? At least three days after touchdown in Manila. Then you let them travel on to their province. I'm hearing quarantining is like 5 days in Manila. How did this one traveler get out of Manila? I'm presuming that's what that little box is showing. 

Well everyone on two returning flights are possibly infected. The immediate contacts of both people while in Manila are possibly infected. Then spread on another flight to its people and the immediate contacts... Where am I going with this? 10 days to Christmas and possibly 100s 1000s of Omicrom infecfections. Lockdowns, faceshields, LGU permission slips, etc.

Why? Did someone not TEST, Not quarantine, wear PPE, oh, I'm sorry. You did. Maybe the test is just not testing. How do you know it's Omicrom? They've been in the country that long? It's Christmas shopping time. That means 10,000 new cases by New Years. Weren't these people vaccinated?

This story does not add up. These two cases should be in a Manila hotel, holed up. Who didn't do their job?

My God, Dec 1. We are learning this, Dec 15.  Is 15 days to test positive or 15 days to test positive and determine the variant. So let's quarantine for 3 days. Yup! Hopefully, they are cured by now. But, no story on that. Wait a minute. I know now. They tested neg after quarantining so while they were traveling to their province, you sent their negative test to a lab to determine the strain. It came back Omicrom. Help me here please! We are two plus years into covid and this happens.

Who am I? I'm a traveler who's ticket was canceled by the airline what seems like a decade ago. I spent a lot of time and money to stay here legally. I have put up with a lot of BS. I can't eat at Jolly Bee because I'm too old. I need LGU permission slips to go to 7-11 plus, S&R needs a Presidential OK to get in. And then the checkout line is 1 hour long. Then someone has to count every item in your cart so you can leave. Bumper to bumper again for 15 more minutes. I have to let my wife cut my hair. Funny? Do you know what it is like to put a pair of scissors in a Filipina's hands? Snip snip. Well at least I can still joke. You know we sleep together every night since covid, but I can't hold her hand in public. And then, that little road side vegetable/fruit/clothing/charging station. Blocking traffic, no faceshields, no permission slips, no masks and no one cares.

The motorcycle driver masking up. His two or more companions, maskless. The tricycle, I'm not even going to go there. I can't fit that many people in my car. Ever try to go into a facility? You got to have a bubble suit on to get inside. Oh, you can remove it once you're inside. Thank God. Wouldn't want covid to leave us to soon.

If this wasn't so funny, I'd complain.

Again, there is already ""mild"" covid that can produce herd immunity, it is called vaccination. 

Please don't produce misinformation and believe everything on the internet. Don't assume things yourselves unless it is proven by professionals. 

If you are in doubt about what I am claiming, it is already in all basic credible biology or medical books. I think it is part of university-level biology too, not sure where you got those absurd ideas.

Just in case, you not are convince, I can give CONS on why it is bad idea:

1. How can you be sure omicron will be the one be spreading? Are you going to have genetic sequencing on ALL covid patients? While vaccine is cheaper. 


2. How about the people who have WEAK immune system wherein common colds can kill them, will you just let them infected as well? (Since you are going to let it loose on the country, how can you separate healthy from immunocompromised)


3. How can you be sure that it will not mutate to more lethal or different virus? More infection = more generation of virus = more chance of mutation


4. There is question of ethics as well, are you willing to GIVE an ACTUAL DISEASE to an INDIVIDUAL even though there is a CHANCE for them to have even mild or worse, severe consequences. Side note too: if you just want immunization, just take the vaccine. Why so hesistant about it?

Edit: What you are suggesting is basically the ACTUAL CONCEPT OF VACCINATION. Why do the riskier way wherein vaccine provides safer, there is also very very very low percentage of side-effect, and there is no chance to have SEVERE complications as compared to the actual virus.",17,0,

No one wants to discuss across the divide and no one even wants to have a meaningful conversation with anyone not agreeing with them.

They forgot that science is all about disagreements, questioning information, and dissection of data, rather than an exercise in democracy by consensus.

1.) Everyone told us, we'd stop needing to wear masks and faceshield once we get the two doses of most vaccines.

This ended up not being the case 
We still are told to wear these anyways.



2.) The health experts and bureaus told us we won't get covid if we vaccinate.

This ended up not being true later on, because now the efficacy of the vaccines are dropping. Now even Pfizer, is advocating a third dose and now a fourth dose, just a day later.


3.) Anyone supporting alternative treatments are demonized to heck, cancelled, and labelled as evil people. This includes the monoclonal antibodies, human dosage ivermectin, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine etc.

The research paper by that Egyptian Doctor Ahmed Elgazzar, supporting ivermectin was ""fact checked"" by a mere medicaL STUDENT, of all people, just because there were typographical and clerical mistakes, common from people who don't have English as a primary first language.

Unlike other Publications of other doctors, Dr. Elgazzar was never allowed to defend or correct his work.
They just ourtright silenced the guy.
 
Media called the drug fucking ""horse paste"" because some idiots bought the paste version, and made the claim that it filled hospitals with these idiots, when those hospitals denied that media claim.


Why am i saying all this?


Because lahat ng medical experts, Fauci, and Tedros, WHO, CDC, karamihan ng may binigyan ng power, mahilig sila magsalita ng patapos, and when they're really proven wrong, di man sila mag apologize and take responsibility to retract their initial statements

And then nagpapadala ang mga Pilipino sa mga snake oil merchants and also nagpapadala ang Pinoy sa scaremongering to the point na mas paniwalaan nila ang salita ng ibang doctor, si Tedros, pero di nila pakikinggan ang ibang doctors na may firsthand experience sa covid and it's variants.


Also, Fun fact:

Punta kayo sa CDC site ng US, at makikita niyo na walang magandang effect ung puro lockdowns and mask mandates.


Sure, downvote niyo ko, pero makikita niyo na mas mababa ang casre rate and death rate ng Florida state versus states na todo lockdowns like New York.

It would depend on your vaccination status. Are you fully vaccinated up to the booster shot? If you are, it's usually 10 days quarantine in a partner hotel then you may finish 14 days at home if you are asymptomatic and your exit RT PCR is negative. 

If you test positive however, you will be transferred to isolate for another 10 days in an isolation facility.

Hope this helps. These are the latest ones they announced effective December 3, 2021. My cousin who is an immigration officer said that the IATF is always changing the guidelines though, almost every 15 days so expect some changes up until your actual travel date.  


This is the IATF resolution being mentioned, if you're interested: [https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2021/12dec/20211202-IATF-RESO-152-RRD.pdf](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2021/12dec/20211202-IATF-RESO-152-RRD.pdf)

Comment,rcugic,Vacation question,mesorta,2021-12-10 01:23:33,"Hey vacation person, rules change like the weather. Buy trip insurance. Be sure to know the airline's rules on covid and trip disruptions. Make sure to comply with vacationing country, (and your trying), but don't forget to comply with the returning from vacation country's covid rules.

Be aware everything can change once your in the air making you ineligible to gain entry. Trip insurance. 

Try nonstop flights like PAL. Avoid China, S Korea, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore only because they may complicate things. Less people in your travel circle the better.

Better have your minimum 2 injections plus the boosters if you qualify. Something to ponder, if you travel between May and June and your booster is due while you are in the Philippines, can you get your booster in the Philippines. They do offer the three covid Vaccines here plus more. Maybe not in your province. 

Don't lose your vaccine passport. Make sure to photograph, (save to the cloud üå• that you know the password to) and make ink and paper copies. Put copies in your pocket, carry-on, check-in just to be over vaccinated. Send a copy to your email. 

Lastly, once you know and prepare, it will change.",3,0,

When I'm in the hotel, how exactly am I supposed to get the PCR test that will determine whether or not I can get out? I'll be allowed out of the hotel to book a test? Or is the hotel supposed to arrange for someone to come to the room?  


And then when you're quarantining from home - what then? At the end of your jail time, you just walk out of the house and live normally again? Or do you have to like, go somewhere and report it? Do people visit you to check up on you? Or are they just trusting that you'll do it?

November 06, 2021

BOC NAIA holds 4th Vaccination Program for Frontliners

In addressing the health and safety of its frontliners, the Bureau of Customs (BOC) Port of NAIA, being the 1st Certified National Government Agency (Non-LGU, Non-Health) to host a vaccination program, conducted its 4th ‚ÄúRESBAKUNA sa Bureau of Customs NAIA‚Äù COVID-19 Vaccination Program for our frontliners on November 06, 2021, in partnership with the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) and the Department of Health (DOH), at the Bureau of Customs-NAIA in Pasay City, Manila.

The BOC, under the leadership of Commissioner Rey Leonardo B. Guerrero remains committed to support the national inoculation program of the IATF and DOH through addressing the health of its frontliners by spearheading vaccination programs to relentlessly perform government service and expeditiously process COVID-19 vaccines in all parts of the country through the Bureau of Customs Ports in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

The inoculation programs of the Bureau of Customs - NAIA to date also enabled the protection of more than 1,400 frontliners both in the government and its partner agencies. Likewise these were opened to all BOC ports nationwide including frontliners from Ports of Batangas and Subic as well as airline logistics. 

The 4th RESBAKUNA was also graced by the presence of the Department of Health - Supply Chain Management Service Director, Dr. Ariel Valencia, who extended his gratitude and congratulations to the Port for the recent milestone in clearing more than 100 million vaccines, and for the continuous efforts in serving as a vaccination facility for the Filipinos, especially frontliners. 

The BOC-NAIA, under the leadership of District Collector Carmelita M. Talusan,  remains committed in initiating reforms and innovations to automate customs process  for  external stakeholders, and prioritise s safety of its personnel and transacting public considering the health risks brought about the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Port of NAIA has also cleared 107 batches of COVID-19 Vaccines consisting of more than 106 million vaccine doses since February 2021. To date, eight brands of vaccines were facilitated by the Port namely Sinovac, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, J&J vaccine, Hayat Vax (Sinopharm), and Sinopharm. During the 1st Resbakuna Program, Secretary Vince Dizon, IATF-EID Testing Czar, expressed his utmost gratitude to the Bureau for the dedication to service since the onset of pandemic. He also recognized the expeditious processing in the clearance of COVID-19 Vaccines. All vaccine shipments were being pre-cleared by the BOC-NAIA One Stop Shop prior to its arrival resulting to a speedy importation process and without any unnecessary delays.

Q1, the DOH posts the number of recoveries of those people who got COVID-19. I would like to know how the DOH track them?  What I heard is that the DOH will consider a person as recovery automatically after 15 days.  Or else?

Q2, do the Filipino need to pay for the hospital if you got CONVID-19?  How much if yes? I know one of my friends paid around 500 K pesos to hospital.",8,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus_PH/comments/qnvyv7/how_the_doh_count_the_number_of_recoveries/

Q2. Yes, but depending on severity of pnuemonia there is a subsidy by PhilHealth. My father was in hospital for three weeks, no ICU, but with expensive meds for the first week to stabilize him and ventilator until 2nd week. He stayed a third week as safety net since he has comorbidities so for the last week he paid mostly just for room, doctor, normal meds. His hospital bill came up to 800k+.

He was brought to the hospital because he blacked out, and his pnuemonia was severe. He was given the ‚Äúsevere‚Äù subsidy which is 333k, plus senior citizen discount (20%). So he just had to pay around 300k+ for everything.",2,0,

Comment,ql70lc,Can ECLIA testing measure my current level of protection from COVID-19?,Chloe0220,2021-11-05 16:27:12,"Hi, just wanted to add an insight here - I‚Äôm not sure about how easy it is to procure the likes of pfizer, moderna etc. realistically speaking with how the admin works with this pandemic. The way I see it, i think more than half of the moderna supply we get or other non-Sinovac are those procured by private companies wherein they were mandated by the gov‚Äôt to supply 50% of their order as donations to LGUs etc.

Even for private companies who have bought for instance, moderna - it takes a while to get all the supplies on hand. I say this because I resigned last july from a local F&B company (a big one actually) and around July they were just starting to roll out to very few people in the company, mostly execs with comorb. Whereas when I transferred to a US company where I currently work, they were able to secure far more moderna vaccines and I would say this is probably because our mother company is in the US so we get more priority. This might also affect how supplies of other vaccines are to the different LGUs.

I got sinovac thru my LGU mid this year and yes I‚Äôm one of those who contracted the virus still but a mild case. Among my household, I was the only one with comorbidity which is my history of asthma. My last asthma occurred last 2018 and I actually though it wouldnt be much of a concern this pandemic because to an extent I‚Äôd already overcome my asthma. I live very healthy, exercise regularly, and had not gone out for around 2 months prior to getting the virus. I was the last person my family expected to have caught the virus in this household - with all the rest having very very very minimal outside contact.

I think because the virus is very unpredictable, I won‚Äôt say I wouldnt have caught the virus if I had another vaccine because as we are already familiar abt it, vaccines just reduces your chances of getting a severe case of covid. 

Maybe yes we‚Äôre all so tired of hearing this that its better tohave vaccines than none but I‚Äôm still an advocate for whatever covid vaccine you can get because I really believe it saved me and my family from anything worse that could have happened. We were a household mixed of different kinds of vaccines - some had astra (got  the vaccine earlier than i did), sinovac (got the vaccine later than i did), pfizer & sputnik (got the vaccine arround the same time as i did) and by this point efficacy rates had varied but no other member contracted the virus. 

I know our situation is difficult but we‚Äôre already facing the difficulties of vaccines not reaching certain areas and whatnot, and I honestly think that‚Äôs a bigger issue we have to face at the moment. Had my family members chosen a different kind of vaccine which could have not been available at the time I got the virus, our situation in this household could have been very much different. Again, just my thoughts on this having experienced covid myself and seeing my relatives contract the virus prior to vaccines being distributed - there‚Äôs a big difference in what I dealt with vs what they had to go through that time.",1,0,
Comment,ql70lc,Can ECLIA testing measure my current level of protection from COVID-19?,lullipy,2021-11-05 16:57:24,"My friend is a corporate lawyer in Cebu Pac, and she also told me that the government wants all private companies to donate half of what they buy. 

I‚Äôm really dismayed by that because:

1. it adds cost for private companies and they aren‚Äôt able to distribute as many doses to their own workers, which would‚Äôve helped business sector operate more safely and recover faster;

2. The government loaned billions so they shouldn‚Äôt have to forced private companies to donate, and should instead help incentivize private procurement as it multiplies efforts;

3. Private vaccination efforts can be more effective and efficient since it already has set structure, reducing strain on LGUs and pressuring vaccination due to work requirements.


The Pfizer/Moderna/AZ doses have so far been readily available now due to donations and recent government procurement when they saw real preference for anything other than Sinovac. This was a welcome development. My family in the province was able to get Pfizer, but we live in the regional capital where supply is steady.

My issue is that we are still continuing to buy Sinovac. It is more expensive (actually government refuses to disclose exact price), not as effective, low preference, and the supply is now steady enough to procure something else. There is simply no excuse to keep using it. And yet we have ordered even more:

https://www.rappler.com/nation/philippine-government-doubles-order-for-sinovac-vaccines

They use the reason that their delivery schedule is more reliable as it is never late, but obviously that is because no one else is buying it. üòë",1,0,
Comment,ql70lc,Can ECLIA testing measure my current level of protection from COVID-19?,Chloe0220,2021-11-05 17:12:28,"Understood on this and yes obviously they wanted private sector to procure so they could get the share for free. For #2 yes this is definitely a long running issue esp w the senate probes on questionable procurements done by our govt agencies in line with the covid response

3. Private vaccination efforts as effective and efficient - I‚Äôd think this only applies for bigger companies, such as MNCs or thriving local companies
- an issue we face here is how there are still a lot of local SMEs who rely on LGUs for their supply. I had my cousin who manages a tshirt business reach out to me for extra supplies of vaccines from my current company because they arent able to secure vaccines for their employees. Struggling even to get a slot thru their LGU.
- Depending on size, having just resigned from a large local F&B industry and having transferred to a US based MNC, supplies are far more quickly provided in my current company. We actually have an oversupply I believe because a lot of the employees have already received the vaccines thru their LGUs; whereas in my prvious company, there‚Äôs a lot more people in stores they need to provide vaccine supplies to + their dependents ++, who are in greater need of the vaccines bec of higher risk of exposure woth their work so I honestly think the LGU pressure is less in metro manila because we‚Äôve already vaccinated a lot more and rollouts have been much faster than it initially was in our respective LGUs. Case in point from what I heard here in Pasig, onti na lang din ang nagpapavaccine because a lot have been vaccinated na rin.

I‚Äôd also had my trusted ENT Covid doctor say sinovac is also an effective vaccine too. ENT doctors are also btw those who handle covid cases from ground zero. In any case Im not defending govt agencies here and their anomalies but I also think rollouts need to expand outside MM. lucky for your family you live in the city of your province but in the case of our househelp‚Äôs family who lives in the barrio of their province, vaccines haven‚Äôt reached them up until this point and afaik they even had covid spread around their little neighborhood. 

Hindi sa settle for less because I really get your point, I hate the fact that I have to pay taxes to just fill these loans by the government but apart from the vaccine brand, there are farther areas that have yet to receive these vaccines and seeing from the two companies I‚Äôve worked with din, it seems that supplies for certain vaccines are easier to get if the company is directly tied to the originating country of the vaccines. Same in my sister‚Äôs case too who works in a UK based company, mas madali silang nakakuha ng AZ stocks and they can even reserve their vaccines for when boosters are allowed. But again, just my thoughts on this! Just also sharing my two cents on the covid vaccines :)",1,0,

October 28, 2021 

BOC marks clearance of 100 MILLION doses of COVID-19 Vaccine 

In full support to the inoculation drive of the national government, the Bureau of Customs through the Port of NAIA on October 28, 2021, processed the release of 896,000 AstraZeneca and 976,950 Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines from Japan and Germany, respectively, bringing the running total number of vaccines cleared by the Bureau of Customs to 100,561,200 vaccines and reaching the immediate goal of having 100-million vaccines in inventory. 

Among those who witnessed the momentous event of the arrival of vaccine shipment reaching the 100 millionth-mark were Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., Vaccine Czar, IATF-EID Testing Czar, DOF Undersecretary Mark Dennis Joven and Bureau of Customs Port of NAIA District Collector Carmelita M. Talusan. 

Exactly 8 months prior to today's achievement was the arrival of the first batch of the life-saving shots containing 600,000 that arrived in the country particularly on February 28, 2021. The Port of Naia has remained vigilant in the cleareance of 100 million vaccines which were processed and released through the advance clearance process of BOC while underguarding duties were also handled by BOC's CoVax Special Handling Taskforce composed of the members of BOC's security and operations unit. 

To date, 8 vaccine brands were processed and cleared by BOC namely Sinovac, AstraZeneca, Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Sputnik V, Hayat-Vax, and Sinopharm jabs. The Port of Naia has consistently supported the arrival of vaccines into the country from the dry-run activity of IATF at the start of 2021 up to the arrival¬† of 101st batch of vaccines¬† which marked 100 million dozes of COVID-19 vaccine. 

The Bureau of Customs, under the direction of Commissioner Rey Leonardo B. Guerrero as well as the Port of NAIA, headed by District Collector Carmelita M. Talusan, remains committed in its full support to national government's vaccination drive and the goal to achieve herd immunity in the Philippines.

Most of those who tested positive are in home quarantine. I got COVID positive last Saturday from a rapid test and I was told to isolate and quarantine in our house. I was then scheduled for an RT-PCR test earlier this day. I don't know if they require people who tests positive in their RT-PCR tests to go to the quarantine facilities now. I've known some who was home quarantined even when they tested positive in RT-PCR. Our governor even blames our municipality for having a high percentage of people being home quarantined but we really shouldn't blame them.

UPDATE: I tested positive in RT-PCR test last October 26, 2021. By the time I tested positive in COVID-19, the number of active cases continued to decrease and a healthcare worker asked me my preferred quarantine site. They didn't allow home quarantine this time, I guess due to number of cases decreasing which means more vacancies on quarantine facilities. As of now, there are only 214 active cases. I guess the number of active cases and the available rooms on quarantine sites can be contributing factors.",3,0,

Comment,qf6moo,"DOH approves guidelines for booster, additional COVID-19 vaccines",SEND_ME_UR_DRAMA,2021-10-25 02:04:29,"The recommendation of the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) includes giving booster shots for healthcare workers and senior citizens six months after they complete the single- or two-dose COVID-19 vaccine.

Meanwhile, immunocompromised patients are recommended to get additional shots of the same brand at least 28 days after they complete their vaccination.

---

Those who completed their Sinovac shots should preferably be given Pfizer or AstraZeneca as their booster six months after completing their two doses.

For those who received Pfizer and single-dose Janssen vaccines, the HTAC said they can only receive the same brand or homologous for their booster.

Those who completed their Moderna shots should ideally be given a Pfizer dose as booster, while a Pfizer booster should be administered to those who received two AstraZeneca shots. The HTAC said they can also get the same brand as their booster.",8,0,

Immunocomprimised would get a 3rd shot of Sinovac? That seems odd based on what I've read elsewhere about the efficacy of a 3rd shot of Sinovac vs a shot of Pfizer.

And, they're saying Janssen should be given another dose of that, when I believe I saw a dose of Pfizer provided something like 70x more antibodies than a second dose of Janssen.

Either way, it's a good thing. Everyone I know now who isn't vaccinated has basically chosen to not do it. I have to yell at them to get them to go.

""He will still get covid even if he gets vaccinated""

Yes, BUT highlight that he is more likely to get infected and more likely to die without vaccines. (Around a low of 1% and high of 6%. if they have any comorbidities it can reach 10+%)

&#x200B;

A Malaysian study as linked below shows result of:

[https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2021/09/730234/unvaccinated-11-times-more-likely-die](https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2021/09/730234/unvaccinated-11-times-more-likely-die)

&#x200B;

""Still not convinced that vaccines are effective""

In what context does he mean by ""effective""? if he means he will no longer get covid-19 after the shot. then yes he is correct it does not prevent infection.

BUT the metric since the start of the pandemic is that vaccines should prevent death. (Ideally 80-90% reduction of risk).

Right now ALL vaccines in PH can do just that. (Astrazeneca, Sinovac, Sinopharm, Pfizer, Moderna etc.)

&#x200B;

Also note that even flu vaccines are not 100% on preventing the flu. just reduces your risks.",6,0,

it's convenient (kinda) cause some establisments wont let you in if you're not partially/fully vaccinated (but I guess those are rare)  
  
he'll still get covid, yes, but it lowers his chance of developing worse symptoms, I'm guessing his letting his machismo take over cause ""malakas naman pangangatawan ko""?  
  
not convinced that vaccines are effective?  
I don't really get this, there's something more to this (like he's afraid of the side effects or maybe he wants a certain brand and don't want to gamble on getting ""lesser"" ones)

In light of the Covid-19 vaccine, these concerns are arising again, with many different denominations having differing opinions on how to approach the vaccine.

Comment,qbtzi2,ABS CBN Data Analytics head Edson Guido explains why the graphic on the current vaccination rates in the country is MISLEADING.,edg19,2021-10-20 23:58:58,"Whenever the national government presents their numbers regarding COVID-19, most of the time it‚Äôs misleading - from the daily case bulletins of the Department of Health to the vaccine statistics. They‚Äôre trying to put a rosier picture of what they think is happening when most of the time, it‚Äôs not.

As for the DOH‚Äôs case bulletins, the ones with the largest font sizes are the percentages of case classifications (deaths, recoveries, and active cases) from the total number of cases. The total number of cases and its classifications have way smaller fonts. Percentages tend to be exaggerated, especially if the denominator is small. Also, the inclusion of ‚Äúhalos __% ang mild at asymptomatic na kaso‚Äù is also misleading. They can cause complacency to the public since they are seeing that the majority of cases are not severe. Another one is that they are not mentioning the number of cases that are being purged daily.

As for the vaccine statistics, it‚Äôs the percentages are causing the problem. They‚Äôre using the target population as their denominator in computing their progress to the vaccine rollout data. The interpretations based on this can lead to misguided decisions.

We have already addressed this here in the subreddit whenever we post COVID-19 figures. The aggregate (total) numbers on DOH reports are larger compared to percentages. The number of purged cases are included in the info boards. Vaccine numbers are compared from the national population more. As much as possible, we don‚Äôt want to cause confusion to people whenever they see the info boards included in our post threads.

Post,q9q3dv,Handling Money/ATM Card from a COVID-Positive Patient/s,kutzco,2021-10-17 02:39:07,"Hi /r/Coronavirus_PH,

My Grandparents were found positive last week for COVID-19 and they're currently in Isolation. I believe it's the 8th day now and they've mentioned (via call) that they were getting better (a little bit) day-by-day. They're asking me to make a withdrawal using their ATM account. But then again, they're both positive for COVID-19.

Unfortunately, my grandparent's account does not have any joint accounts and withdrawing via representative over-the-counter/transferring via online is not possible since the prerequisites are some legal requirements and selfie verification (my grandparents do not have a smartphone).

Would it be alright handling their ATM card as long as preventive measures are done? Here's what I was planning to do:

1.) Grandparents will put the ""disinfected"" ATM card in a zip-loc bag (they will not be present within the area of course).

2.) Get the Zip-Loc bag while wearing protective gloves > place the zip-loc bag in a protective box before entering the car > remove gloves when driving and dispose on a safe bin.

3.) Wear new set of gloves when getting the ATM card and transacting on the ATM machine.

4.) Repeat Step 2.

5.) Wear new set of Gloves > place the ATM card on the same Zip-loc bag > return to the same place.

The Bureau of Customs-Port of NAIA (BOC-NAIA) and the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) cleared a total of 2,977,650 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines, which arrived in four (4) shipments from October 10-14, 2021. 

Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine shipments containing 918,450 on October 10, two shipments containing a total of 1,196,910 doses on October 11, and one shipment containing 939,510 doses on October 14 arrived at different terminals, and were cleared and released by BOC-NAIA and were immediately escorted to the designated cold storage facility. Prior to these arrivals, said shipments were also pre-cleared by the NAIA's One Stop Shop.

Earlier this year, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine from the United States of America was granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Last May 2021, the first batch of Pfizer vaccine-shipment arrived in the Philippines and was pre-cleared and released by Bureau of Customs. To date, more than 19 million doses of Pfizer vaccines have already been cleared by the Bureau since May.

Under the leadership of Commissioner Rey Leonardo B. Guerrero, the Port of NAIA headed by District Collector Carmelita M. Talusan, commits to expeditiously facilitate the processing and release of COVID-19 vaccine shipments in full support of the government‚Äôs vaccination program to address the COVID-19 pandemic.",2,0,

Comment,q7q4u4,The latest IATF quarantine classifications make no sense [Explanation in Comments],PhilippineLeadX,2021-10-14 04:31:36,"I feel your frustration. One alternative hypothesis is that IATF leans more on the political gauge to decide on the class of restriction.   

MECQ Cavite, GCQ Davao?    
You know who are the national candidates & government top bosses residing in Davao?     

---

The IATF is mainly composed by those retired generals (Gen. Ano, Gen. Esperon, Gen. Galvez Jr., Gen. Lorenzana, Gen. Cimatu) and non-medical degree holders (maybe, except for Duque).    

Their IATF resolutions from 2020 read like they were preparing for combat (I.e. Reso 22. Intensify risk communication of NTF to End Local Communist Armed Conflict STRATCOM. Then, there's the creation of multiple Task groups and sub task groups) instead of using science to contain the virus.    

When we were wrapping up our analysis of NCR cases vs quarantine class, one amazing thing that stood out; while the cases grew, restrictions relaxed.    

Anyway, I'm oing off a tangent here. Just sharing here what I can't write in our report.    

Good luck to us. Hope we have better leaders in May 2022.",15,0,
Comment,q7q4u4,The latest IATF quarantine classifications make no sense [Explanation in Comments],dub4u,2021-10-14 02:23:48,"The IATF uses Average Daily Attack Rate (ADAR) and Two Week Growth (2WGR) to determine what quarantine classification should be declared for a region or city. Normally, governments around the world start to apply quarantine restrictions at an ADAR of over 7.

Looking at the classification however, we see that MGCQ (lowest level) classification has been given to regions with ADAR ranging from 0.26 (Sulu) to 41.27 (Mt. Province). Likewise the highest classification (MECQ, which prevents people from leisure traveling) has been given to regions with an ADAR range of 8.3 (Bulacan) to 45 (Batanes).

If you have a close look at the data things just don't make sense. For example (ADAR in brackets)

* Why is La Union (36.8) MGCQ, but Ilocos Sur (32) GCQ+?
* Why is Bulacan (8.3) MECQ but Angeles City (9.1) MGCQ?
* Why is Cavite (10.6) MECQ but Davao City (11.2) GCQ?
* Why is Lapu-Lapu City (4.9) GCQ+ but Cebu City (4.1) GCQ? 
* Why aren't both Lapu-Lapu and Cebu City classed as MGCQ? Both have ADAR below 7 and negative growth rate!
* How are Baguio (65) and Siquijor (68) the subdivisions with the **highest ADAR in the country *not* classified MECQ???**

These are just a few examples, there is so much more weird classifications that an explanation should really be given by the IATF!",14,0,

Let‚Äôs take Israel and Singapore for example. They have vaccinated almost 90% of their population and cases are still surging. Now they are giving booster shots. These are rich countries and can afford expensive vaccines. For Philippines, we have to implement a different strategy. Vaccination is one but we need to find a way, first, prevent the transmission and second, treat early as 90% of the cases are mild and moderate cases. If we are good at these two steps, fewer will be hospitalized and die. Unfortunately, the government has been vaccine-centric from the very beginning and forgot the basic steps, prevent and treat early. I would rather invest time and money in these two key areas, especially in early treatment as we have so many cheap, safe and effective options.",5,0,

We are obvs much more vulnerable because of our poor healthcare system and heavy reliance on in-person businesses and mass transportation. 

But the government has also clearly seen more headway for loosening restrictions despite the high numbers -- they will open up the economy as much as they can as long as they can control the narrative and they've proven at least for now that they still can.

Post,q1lxvu,"(NOTICE) Updates and changes to the Vaccine Statistics threads starting from the figures for September 28, 2021",edg19,2021-10-05 02:59:21,"If you haven't noticed it yet, the updates regarding Vaccine Statistics in the r/Coronavirus_PH subreddit for the past two weeks or so are not consistent (not being posted on a regular \[daily\] basis). During the said time period, we were testing new infoboards that will be included in the Vaccine Statistics threads due to the availability of data. We would like to apologize for the inconvenience that this might have caused.

Fortunately, the construction of new infoboards is now complete and will be available starting from the vaccine rollout data for September 28, 2021. **Five infoboards** will be added from the current 15, making the overall number of infoboards for the Vaccine Statistics threads to 20, the maximum (number of pictures) that Reddit allows per thread. The five infoboards are as follows:

# 1. Vaccine Supply Composition

[Vaccine Supply Composition \(as of September 28, 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/3k4madkdijr71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca80d126a498df282656f0e93bfb7bead6c5b935)

The Vaccine Supply Composition infoboard, as the name states, will show the composition of the COVID-19 vaccine supplies that the Philippines has (in terms of percentage shares, by order of the first arrival of the vaccines). The different shades in the graph representing different brands of vaccines that the country has either acquired by donation or procurement will change their areas at the rightmost side once new vaccine supply deliveries arrive.

# 2. Booster Shots Statistics

[Booster Shots Statistics \(as of September 28, 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/1nkea02yjjr71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&s=e20f7086c30cea47c2af4f91fa240a01bd29fedc)

Sooner or later, booster shots against COVID-19 will be administered as the vaccines' efficacies wane over time. Certain vaccine brands have reported drops in their vaccines' efficacies and are recommending booster doses to be administered to increase protection against the pandemic. To monitor the future vaccine rollout for booster doses, the Booster Shots Statistics infoboard was created.

A fully vaccinated person becomes eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot after six months from the date of the inoculation of the 2nd dose of a two-dose vaccine or the administration of the single-dose vaccine (e.g. Janssen, Sputnik Light). However, booster doses are not yet recommended by the Department of Health due to vaccine supply concerns (there are not enough doses to administer booster shots for now). The time frame (in this case, six months) will change as soon as the DOH gives updates on the particulars regarding booster doses.

# 3. Vaccine Priority Groups

[Vaccine Priority Froups infoboard \(as of September 28, 2021\).](https://preview.redd.it/1744x0p1mjr71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aed588de415b286999603c9b36c2db5668ab380)

The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the Philippines follows a priority list, where people who are most at risk from the pandemic will be given priority on being given vaccine jabs. The list includes frontline medical workers, senior citizens, and persons with comorbidities. Vaccine priority lists can change if the situation allows it, like the inclusion of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) with employment contracts and the immediate family members of frontline medical workers who were not initially given priority.

The Vaccine Priority Groups infoboard will show the number of vaccine doses being administered to every priority group. The vaccine dose figures are divided per the classification of the shot (whether the dose was administered as a first dose, second dose, or booster). The daily changes in the total number of vaccine doses administered will also be shown.

# 4. Vaccine Doses Administered per Priority Group Graph

[Vaccine Doses Administered per Priority Group \(as of September 28, 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/s7ves7wunjr71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&s=51fefda70d401d695bb7ef0468aa28c188d928b6)

The Vaccine Doses Administered per Priority Group graph will show how the COVID-19 vaccines have been allocated and inoculated to different priority groups over time, from the start of the vaccine rollout on March 1, 2021, up to the latest update. As the vaccine rollout will include more persons to the priority list over the next couple of days like children ages 12-17, the graph will monitor the said changes.

# 5. Vaccine Doses Administered per Day per Priority Group Graph

[Vaccine Doses Administered per Day per Priority Group \(as of September 28, 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/l5988xkxojr71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&s=06d1503edce55929b1974568cf40c74d65784918)

The Vaccine Doses Administered per Day per Priority Group graph will show the illustration of the 7-day moving averages of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout per priority group over time, from the start of the said program on March 1, 2021, up to the latest update.

The said graph can give some clues and probably some explanations on how fast or slow the vaccine rollout is per priority group, like the spike of vaccine doses being administered to A2 and A3 priority groups from mid-July to mid-August due to the availability of the single-dose Janssen vaccine, which the A2 and A3 groups were given priority.

\---

With these new infoboards, we hope that we can give new and improved information regarding the COVID-19 vaccine rollout program. Again, we would like to apologize for any inconvenience that the testing for the said infoboards has caused as it affected the posting of the entire Vaccine Statistics threads.

> She also noted the experts' recommended vaccination intervals for some vaccine brands being used in the country based on studies conducted. For Pfizer and Moderna, interval could be up to 42 days, and Sputnik V up to 90 days.
> 
> Acceptable interval for the two shots of Sinovac was not stated, but she noted that the second shot should be administered ‚Äúas soon as possible.‚Äù

So it's a bit confusing.

There's another [article](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-happens-if-you-miss-your-second-covid-vaccine/) that says:

> In the United Kingdom, a shortage of available vaccines led to the decision to delay most second doses of the Pfizer vaccine up to 12 weeks so as many people as possible could receive the first dose. In May, a study said that older patients who waited that 12-week interval had higher antibody levels than those who waited the standard 3 weeks between doses.

But still strange. PCR tests after a few days are definitely not worthless if they wanted to verify that you're positive. Some PCR results would still identify viral particles and return positive up to 2 mos after your initial symptom(s) which is why testing after 14 days isn't required (even discouraged). One doctor I've talked to said it's due to a high antibody count, but I'm not an expert on viruses, so I'll have to defer to him.

If you want to be 100% safe against the virus, you need higher level of PPE but those are reserved for the frontliners. 

Besides, as long as the person is vaccinated, he/she has less chance of having severe complications. We can't avoid the virus 100%, what we can do is have antibodies (the vaccine) against it.

I'm living in South East Asia at the moment and I have the opportunity to take any covid vaccine.

Comment,px3vuf,Which covid vaccine?,KaiserPhilip,2021-09-28 14:25:49,"If moderna is being offered, Moderna is looking like the best, but you're in SEA so access to ""choosing"" can vary.",11,0,
Comment,px3vuf,Which covid vaccine?,furansisu,2021-09-29 07:37:32,"Let me start things off by saying that I'm not a doctor, nor am I a healthcare worker in any capacity, and I have not done any actual research on COVID (meaning I have not participated in actual studies or published anything in a peer-reviewed journal). Everything I am about to tell you is based on my own observations from news media, personal experience, and the advice of people who I consider worth listening to.

Next, I highly doubt you have exactly equal access to all vaccine brands, so in general the best advice is still to get what is readily available to you. Meaning, do not wait for a better vaccine because the sooner we get as many people vaccinated, the better. People need to stop seeing this pandemic as an individual and start thinking of us as a collection population going through this. However, the rest of my comment will assume that you have equal access, meaning you have a doctor or nurse asking you what vaccine you want, and you can get it within the next hour, and all you have to do is choose.

The first thing you need to consider is your lifestyle. What level of efficacy do you need? A lot of people in this thread have pointed out that Sinovac isn't effective, and they keep linking to the news story about Indonesian doctors dying of COVID. However, keep in mind that doctors and other HCWs don't have the same lifestyle that most people have. They regularly encounter unvaccinated COVID patients several times a day, day after day. Most people I know do not knowingly enter spaces with COVID patients in it. Since the beginning of this pandemic, it has been confirmed that the quantity of exposure matters, so doctors who are exposed to the virus much more than the general population would obviously need better protection. But for most people, Sinovac is fine and wouldn't make a big difference in the greater scheme of things.

I also want to point out that, in terms of lifestyle, no vaccine gives you a license to throw away all other safety protocol. You still need to continue wearing masks and avoiding crowded, unventilated spaces. In fact, a lot of the countries in the world where COVID is seeing a resurgence are countries that put too much faith in the vaccines and decided to junk the other protocol. This is what's happening in places like the USA and Israel. Despite these countries getting the ""more effective"" Western vaccines, COVID is running rampant there because they became complacent.

The next thing you need to consider is your own health. Of course, the only person that would be able to truly analyze this aspect would be your doctor who knows your medical history. But you do need to consider if you have any allergies or intolerances to any vaccine components.

In terms of health, you also need to consider the kind of side-effects you want to deal with. Sinovac is probably known for having the weakest side-effects. The worst I've heard from people getting Sinovac was a slight fever lasting less than a day. I only experienced a sore arm for both my doses. On the other hand, everyone I know who got Moderna or Pfizer were feeling feverish two days later. So if you can't stand to not go to work, then you may want to think about your choices. Johnson & Johnson was even worse. I had to nurse my girlfriend for almost a week after getting her dose of that vaccine. She was initially super happy to get that vaccine because she's afraid of needles and that brand is single-dose (another consideration), but by the forth day of fever, body pains, and a complicated relationship with food, she told me that she wished she had gotten any other brand instead (not that she had a choice because she only found out when she got to the vaccination site).

You should probably also consider your relationship with side-effects of medicines in general. Are you the type to experience rare side-effects. My girlfriend is the type who, if a medicine says that 1 in 100,000 people will experience a side-effect, she will experience it. So she did appear to get blood clots from the J&J vaccine, and we were super scared because this country doesn't have the proper infrastructure to deal with it. Luckily, the blood clots haven't killed her. They're still there, and they hurt a bit when you press down on them, but they're a minor inconvenience at worst. If this sounds like it could be you, then that might be an additional consideration.

Another consideration would be your timeline as to when you want to be fully vaccinated. While most vaccines allow you to get the second dose a month before your first, there are exceptions. Astra Zenica only lets you get the second dose three months after the first. Sputnik V has had a lot of supply issues recently, making it uncertain when you'll get a second dose. This means that if you were to get Sinovac, Pfizer, or Moderna, you would be fully vaccinated in six weeks from your first dose (one month between doses plus another two weeks for the second dose to kick in). J&J would have you fully vaccinated in two weeks from your only dose. Astra Zenica would have you fully vaccinated 14 weeks from your first dose. Sputnik V or any other vaccine that experiences supply issues would depend on how lucky you are.

Last consideration I can think of, albeit a minor one, would be your future travel plans. You should note that, even if Chinese vaccines end up being as effective as Western vaccines, there is discrimination against them, whether warranted or unwarranted. For instance, in a lot of places in Europe, you need to be fully vaccinated to enter a museum or eat at a restaurant. And they don't consider Sinovac as an actual vaccine. I know this from an acquaintance who is vaccinated with Sinovac, went to Italy, and had to get tested every two days during his trip to be able to do basic things. Otherwise, he wouldn't be allowed entry into establishments.

In the end, the choice is yours.",10,0,
Comment,px3vuf,Which covid vaccine?,raging_phoenis,2021-09-29 01:45:36,"Any. The best one is the one available to you. A lot of people i know took sinovac or sputnik v because it was readily available and waiting for western brand vaccines could take months. There were breakthrough infections with sinovac but they only experienced mild symptoms at worst. In household of 4 of which 1 was fully vaccinated, 1 partially with sinovac and 2 had none, the unvaccinated experienced worse symptoms and needed hospitalization. Not a very scientific observation but still a bit of evidence that having any vaccine is better than having none at all. 

If you have the luxury of getting western brand vaccines I do highly recommend them. I was lucky enough to get pfizer. But if you need to wait for a few months then whatever is available at the moment will do, booster shots could do the trick later on.",4,0,

[Sinopharm](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know) may have higher efficacy against symptomatic infections, but certainly lower than [Sinovac](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know) against severe cases as well as hospitalization (which is really what the vaccines are made for). 

For delta, sinopharm still has no data that the WHO has updated, so we still can't say for a fact which is higher.

And that's just one vaccine. Yes, for mrna vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna, Sinovac has lower efficacy. But saying it's the lowest when there are other vaccines used in SEA is not a fact. OP did not specify which country he is in.",1,0,

""breakthrough cases occur, meaning the vaccine is garbage or useless""

I said it as it is. No double meaning or anything. Even if a vaccine were done in USA or anywhere if it use same methods and/or process with sinovac it is still fake. Same goes with other vaccines even if it were to be manufactured in china.

Comment,puw250,Quirino Grandstand Drive Thru Vaccination,hanahone,2021-09-25 00:37:34,"I tried posting this 3 days ago, i'm not sure why it wasn't posted at all.

----

Just wanted to share this drive thru vaccination. For those who weren't able to get a schedule from the Solairevax, you might also want to consider this. I actually got this info from one of the comments in this subreddit. I just can't remember from who. So thank you!

1. Vaccine: Pfizer. I don't want to assure you that this is going to be the vaccine they'll use here in the next days as well. But according to the previous people who got vaccinated here, ever since they opened, they only use Pfizer. (Sep 21)

2. How to register: Create an account on: ManilaCovax https://www.manilacovid19vaccine.ph/home.php.

3. How to schedule: So every Friday Night, the FB page of Manila PIO posts an announcement that slots are open to book a schedule.  And those slots are slots for the ff week. Slots are not easily filled up. It usually takes a couple of hours or so. Just login to your ManilaCovax account and then you'll see a button to pick a schedule. You'll receive a text messsge immediately after you successfully scheduled a slot.

Pro Tip: I started waiting at around 6pm, because I wanted to ensure I secure a slot. I just had the fb page open and refresh it every 5 mins or so, and 1 tab open for the manilacovid19 website.

4. The good thing about this is you can bring +3 other people during your schedule. You just need one account/person to secure a slot/schedule and then make sure thos people are also registered in the ManilaCovax wesbite. Then just add them in your family members tab in your account.

5. Experience: Show the text message you received to the marshal and make sure to print the waiver that can be accessed in your ManilaCovax account. We arrive at around 9:30am, finished past 10:30am. There will be no vaccine card, you'll have a virtual card accesible in your ManilaCoVax Account. For the second dose, you're automatically scheduled after 21 days. Just need to show your QR code thats included in the digital vaccine card. 

Pro Tip: Don't go too early like as early as 7am, because accdg to the marshals there, they still have to prep and mix the vaccine.

This is available to anyone. Just like the solairevax, just input any barangay during the registration.


Update: They just posted last night and opened slots for next week. Unfortunately, all slots are already booked. Just wait for the annoucement next friday again.",6,0,

Come to think of it... I wonder how would the Grab app fairly compute the fare, since (as far as I know) it calculates the amount of km travelled from pickup to dropoff + the flagdown rate.    
More questions: How much would the total cost be if the queue would just be 250 meters but the waiting time is 1 hour? Would the price be worth it for the driver?

Wala pa din kami pang amoy and panlasa plus the coughing but I think we're kind of ok naman. Yung parents lang namin is mej matamlay pa din. They're doing better na pero still sick. They don't have fever anymore but coughing is still present. We let them use oxygen whenever bumababa ng slight yung o2. Normal naman all laboratory tests nila like xray and everything but it's been more than a week already. Any tips para faster pa yung recovery. Plus how can we recover our sense of smell din.

For my lolo, we made him take ConZace twice a day, Pocari Sweat for electrolytes, and fruits, and suob every night. On the other hand, my tita likes to make lemon ginger tea and we drink it nightly. 

For loss of smell, there are exercises u could do to bring the nerves back. One is, A quick sniff to essential oils twice a day to relearn sensory.

Try smelling diff scents like coffee, citrus, peppermint, vanilla etc. to help your brain remember the things you used to smell. I've read an article where in there's a [smell training](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-regain-sense-of-smell-naturally#methods-to-try) that you can do.

Also, you cannot fully recover after just 14 days. I tested negative on my 10th day but I would sometimes get runny nose when it's hot then it will eventually go after few mins. Some people that I know will still have DOB when they are walking and cannot sleep well at night.

Yun nalang talaga ang medyo iniinda ko pero kontento na ako sa improvement, feeling ko nasa 90 percent na sya.

About dun sa wasabe kung legit ba? Nung panahon na sobrang paranoid na ako kung babalik pa ba pangamoy ko, nagisip talaga ako ng paraan kung paano ko malalaman kung may pakiramdam pa ba ilong ko kasi baka utak na nadale sakin ng virus. Pag utak daw kasi irreversible na so para lang mapanatag ako na nakakaramdam pa ako ng pain kumain ako ng wasabi. Paraan ko lang yun bro para malaman ko kung may nararamdaman pako.

It was tough being isolated from them. Now that I am done with my isolation and recuperation it is back to work. Given that delta is here to stay and the risks of my exposure at work cannot be further lessened I will be living apart from my family temporarily to prevent further risk of exposure.

While filtering for the NCR cases in the RegionRes column (using python), I'm weirdly getting NaN values or empty cells. My interpretation is, these are covid cases but have incomplete info--in this instance, it's missing a region.

1. Antigen tests work best on symptomatic people and within medical context. Not efficient to randomly test asymptomatic people.

False positives in RT-PCRs are because of non-standardized Cts (cycle threshold).

From a conversation I had with my (old school) doctor, he prefers this much more than any other type of vaccine to administer to his athletes because he thinks that it is the ""safest"" among all the other types of vaccine. 

Although I do not exactly completely agree with his statement, I think this should give you some background on what the vaccine is and why it should be relatively safe. I am sure you have heard: *the best vaccine is the available vaccine.* Any of the available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will not prevent you from getting infected post-vaccination, but all available vaccines have been shown to successfully prevent severe disease (including Sinovac). 

Regarding vaccine + antibiotics, I do not see why not but you should ask your healthcare provider or the doctor onsite!

While there is partial data usable at the current status quo, the high positivity rate implies that there are a lot more cases not captured in current testing.

Say you have a brgy (or even street level as the granular protocols seem to indicate) without a hospital and very few residents go through testing due to the cost. How the hell are LGUs going to know that the area is already a hotspot so they can lock it down? By the time enough residents get into the system and hospitals, COVID would already have been widespread at that point so the lockdown will just be damage control instead of being preventative measures.

I'm not optimistic that they're going to suddenly wise up but we can always clamor for better governance/management.",5,0,

Nope. April was higher. Vaccinations are working. 

Reject all the alarmist misinformation trying to convince the public that vaccinations don't work and we should revert to other methods like draconian lockdown or ""contact tracing"" that is so invasive of privacy that it violates the Philippine Data Privacy Act. In reality, UK is seeing a similar surge in infections, but much lower (indeed flu-level insignificant) levels of hospitalization thanks to their 70%+ vaccination rate.

Puro kasi politika inuuna. That's why the guys demanding contact tracing now are the same people who were against the government Covid tracking apps last year, because they were afraid of being ""red-tagged"" or tokhang'd. Apparently the huge infection numbers are terrifying them to the point they _want_ to give the government police state powers now.",2,0,

BOC-NAIA clears 3,015,000 Sinovac & Sputnik V vaccines 

The Bureau of Customs Port of NAIA on August 31, 2021 facilitated the expeditious release of 3,000,000 Sinovac vaccines at Terminal 2 via PR359 and 15,000 Sputnik V vaccines at Terminal 3 via QR932 on the same day. 

The shipments were pre-cleared last August 30, 2021 via the BOC-NAIA COVID-19 One-Stop-Shop. Upon arrival, said vaccines were immediately transported and underguarded to Pharmaserv Cold Storage Facility, the DOH designated facility. 

As of date, seven (7) vaccine brands with more than 50 million total doses were processed and released by the Bureau of Customs - 29.5M Sinovac, 1M Sinopharm, 8.43M Astrazenca, 4.96M Pfizer-BioNTech, 380K Sputnik V, 4.30M Moderna, 3.24M Johnson & Johnson, and 100K Hayat Vax COVID-19 vaccines. 

In addressing the safety and welfare of its frontliners who provide government service 24/7 to facilitate these critical commidities, BOC also held their vaccination program in Port of NAIA, in partnership with the IATF and DOH, entitled ""RESBAKUNA sa Bureau of Customs NAIA"" vaccination programs last June 19, July 17, and August 14, 2021 for the inoculation of its 1,357 airport frontliners. Port of NAIA is also the 1st Certified National Government Agency (Non-LGU, Non-Health Facility) to host¬† vaccination programs. 

The Bureau of Customs under the leadership of Commissioner Rey Leonardo B. Gurerro and the Port of NAIA, headed by District Collector Carmelita M.

It's stated that it is not mandatory for the private companies to donate but it is *encouraged*.

It's not the private companies that handles the arrival and distribution of the vaccines, it's the government. So who would get their hands on it first? Would it clear customs if they didn't donate? The use of the word *it is encouraged* is a gentle term used for *compliance*.

For the inspection of procured goods, it's easy to deceive a COA inspector just a few pictures attached with the receipts and contracts -company to government transaction not company to vaccine seller.(the purchase passes through private companies who can make invoices and receipts that can be issued-yes receipts can be issued by private companies and name it to a government organization and it can and will make it through audit).

COA won't gain traction despite how scrupulous they are to the details and meticulous to the files submitted for deficiencies as again, the procurement law is easy to circumvent if you know how to and if you have the right people.",8,0,
Comment,pd0pch,Here's a copy of the waiver for the Solaire Nayong Filipino drive-thru vaccination. Looks like they're really exclusively using Moderna,Nyebe_Juan,2021-08-28 06:39:08,"Go check the reports on purchased vaccines versus donated. It's the receipt that matters and it's easy to pass through COA as long as you have good receipts and documents.

Not everything you see in the news is what it is it with the actual files submitted. Why do you think COA have lots of flags recently?

We are also taking up another loan for *purchase of vaccines* and check out the ratio of vaccines within the country and the number of vaccine dosed administered.

Each vial can inoculate an estimated average of 5-6 people. The number of vaccine delivery is per vial, not per jab. The number of vaccinated individuals is proportional to the number of jabs not the number of vials.

If you want a source on how vaccines were took, don't bother as the private companies will not speak out on the incident.

There is no National tally of vaccinated people, only per LGU. We have people vaccinated by the private firms or companies who were lucky enough to purchase.

So you have a data presented in the news with the count of vials delivered but there is no count on who purchased it. There's a total number of vaccinated people but you do not have a distinction on which was vaccinated by the private company and which was vaccinated by the LGUs. What's published in the news is that *the government accomplished the vaccination of jabs to the number of people*.

Procurement law was bypassed by using the pandemic as a reason, so the case with face masks and face shields will have no traction, the problem is that the law cannot hold people liable unless there is no explanation for the purchases and there are no receipts. The bureaucratic procedures that safeguard everything (request for funding, notice for bidding, actual bidding, purchase, inspection of purchased items) are easy to bypass. The pandemic is a perfect explanation to nullify investigations on questionable expenses. The law is about the price and delivery of the goods, not the quality.",4,0,

Post,pcjfyh,Update on the Nayong Filipino drive-thru vaccination: Finally got the first dose. Took appx 2 hours to get it done.,PhilippineLeadX,2021-08-27 08:45:28,"Hello everyone, I'd like to share some pointers on our experience with the drive-thru vaccination at Nayong Filipino, Paranaque.    

_To those who missed the first post regarding the vaccination registration, here's the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus_PH/comments/p96gde/solairenayong_filipino_drive_thru_vaccination_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)_

1. It took about 2 hours from queue up to the jab.    

2. Coming from NAIAx, we reached the area at around 11:50am, our booking was 12:00pm. At the off ramp, we could already see the long line of vehicles. We recieved the jab at around 2:00pm.    

On your vaccination schedule, it's best to go to the site at around 9:00am or earlier (regardless of the time that you were scheduled).    

3. For us, the queue started from the Rotunda between Ayala Malls and Solaire Casino, snaking around the U-turn at the Coastal Overpass. If you arrive late, go straight to the Rotunda to beat other drivers who are confused or still asking for direction.    

Here's the view from the Solaire-Okada area: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus_PH/comments/pcga95/current_queue_of_cars_for_the_nayong_filipino/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

4. The eZConsult app might not work on the day of your vaccination, so print the QR Code or Save it on your phone.    

5. Internet connection will be unreliable in the area so print the QR Code or Save it on your phone.    

6. It can be a long wait. If you're the type of person who pee a lot, the nearest toilet would be inside the vaccination site. Else, if you don't like to mingle with the rest of the herd, you'd have to be creative.    

7. Once you enter the site, they'll first scan your QR Code & verify your government issued ID.    

8. Then, they'll make you sign a waiver (I'll try to post the photo of the waiver). After that, they'll send you to the vaccination area.    

9. A doctor would ask you a few questions and inform you of the potential side effects.    

10. Once done, she'll write a note with the schedule for the 2nd dose. She'll then ask the nurses to inject the vaccine. Done. You wouldn't need to ever get out of your vehicle.

|Type|Estimate Date\^|Change from prev. update^(+)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Aggregate (best est.)|**July 12, 2022**|\+14 days|Computed based on the assumption that the 140 million doses will be used for exactly 70 million people. This is what you normally see in vaccine trackers when they say the approximate date of herd immunity.|
|Partial (one of two doses\*)|**March 1, 2022**|\-26 days|Computed based on how many doses are being administered as first doses.|

Notes:

\* -  All COVID-19 vaccines that have been given Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration require two doses for every person, with the exception of the Janssen vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, which only requires one dose. The EUA for the Sputnik V vaccine from Gamaleya may be amended to be a one-dose vaccine (with pending documents and trial results).

\^ - Estimated dates are computed based on the 7-day moving averages of the vaccine rollout (doses administered per day). Computation will be greatly affected by the availability of data coming from the national government by the National Vaccination Operations Center (NVOC). Margin of error at +/- 1 day due to rounding.

\+ - A positive change indicates that the vaccine rollout is getting slower; a negative change indicates that the vaccine rollout is picking up pace.

There will be instances wherein the estimated date based on second doses is earlier/faster than that on first doses. It can be possible if the 7-day moving average of administering second doses is faster than the rate of inoculating first doses.

The breakdown of the 18k cases yesterday can be seen here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/pai9cx/summary\_of\_covid19\_cases\_in\_the\_philippines\_as\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/pai9cx/summary_of_covid19_cases_in_the_philippines_as_of/)

As for the Delta variant situation in the Philippines, given that 62.47% of the latest batch of samples tested are Delta variant cases, and the genome sequencing can take as long as two weeks to get results, we can assume that around 62.47% of the cases that we were seeing two weeks ago were Delta variant cases. The percentage can go higher after that. However, this is just an assumption since the Department is doing risk-based testing when it comes to sequencing for variants, meaning they only get samples from places where there are spikes/surges in cases.",3,0,

The total number of vaccine doses administered has reached 30 million. Est. dates for herd immunity (70M people) in the comment section.,edg19,2021-08-23 06:32:22,"Estimate date for achieving herd immunity (70 million people):

|Type|Estimate Date\^|Change from prev. update^(+)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Aggregate (best est.)|**June 7, 2022**|\-191 days|Computed based on the assumption that the 140 million doses will be used for exactly 70 million people. This is what you normally see in vaccine trackers when they say the approximate date of herd immunity.|
|Partial (one of two doses\*)|**February 10, 2022**|\-134 days|Computed based on how many doses are being administered as first doses.|
|Full (two of two doses\*)|**July 27, 2023**|\-256 days|Computed based on how many doses are being administered as second doses.|

Notes:

\* -  All COVID-19 vaccines that have been given Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration require two doses for every person, with the exception of the Janssen vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, which only requires one dose. The EUA for the Sputnik V vaccine from Gamaleya may be amended to be a one-dose vaccine (with pending documents and trial results).

\^ - Estimated dates are computed based on the 7-day moving averages of the vaccine rollout (doses administered per day). Computation will be greatly affected by the availability of data coming from the national government by the National Vaccination Operations Center (NVOC). Margin of error at +/- 1 day due to rounding.

\+ - A positive change indicates that the vaccine rollout is getting slower; a negative change indicates that the vaccine rollout is picking up pace.

\---

There will be instances wherein the estimated date based on second doses is earlier/faster than that on first doses. It can be possible if the 7-day moving average of administering second doses is faster than the rate of inoculating first doses. If the overall vaccination rates (from the start of the vaccine rollout on March 1, 2021) are used, the estimated herd immunity rates are as follows:

I would like to share here the websites for those that would like to have drive thru vaccination as well.

We first filled out the OneParanaque form: https://m.oneparanaque.info/

Then, we also filled out this Paranaque Google form just to increase the odds: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1sUS0pov9n8pU5HvTnl-Qaa0n55sQTTbrIpkQ3o0yG9Tj0A/viewform

When the form asks for your Paranaque baranggay, just choose Baclaran (or whatever you like. It doesn't matter).    

When it asks for your address, that's where you answer your residence address.    

For us, it took 24-hours to receive a SMS confirmation.

That SMS notification would come from eZConsult and should read something like this:

>Dear [your name], Your account has been successfully created on eZConsult-eZVax. Patient ID: [123456],  Email: [your email],  Password: [your birthday date]. Download eZconsult from a. Google Play Store: bit.ly/2ZV63Mr. b. Download from Apple App Store: apple.co/3fVGl05. Click on the link to log in https://app.ezconsult.io/. You will be scheduled by your HR admin. Wait for the booking confirmation.. Thank you!

Download the app and use the login credentials provided to you. Complete your profile from there.

After a few minutes, you'll then receive a second SMS:

>Hi [your name], your vaccination appointment has been confirmed for patient ID: [123456] for NPF Drive Through, Date: 01/01/0000 00:00PM. Please bring your government issued ID to the vaccination center. Staff will be checking the correctness of your inputs. Thank you.

Then, you'll recieve an email confirmation as well from ""support.ezconsult@interpharmasolutions.com"" which should read like this:

>Greetings!

>Your 1st dose vaccination appointment is now confirmed. Please see the attached Patient QR code and the booking details below for reference. Your appointment schedule is pre-assigned by your company HR. If you need to re-schedule, kindly get in touch with your HR.

>Patient Name:

>Reporting Time:

It takes time to get booked though, so I would suggest you try Makati and San Juan's non-resident vaccination/booster program.    

You may fill out their forms here:    
#Please remember to chose NON-RESIDENT
1. [Makati](https://www.covid19vaccine.safemakati.com)    
2. [San Juan](https://vaxreg.sanjuancity.gov.ph/vaccine_registration/public)    

We registered on both websites for our booster and got confirmations. Makati books faster than San Juan based from our experience.

I wasn't able to read any restrictions regarding the number of people inside a vehicle. (For us, there will be a total of 4 inside our vehicle).

>Do we all need to register? 

Absolutely. They will not entertain anyone who is not registered/booked. According to the website, they won't allow walk-ins.

>And what if we get different appointment dates and time? 

That would suck. You would need to follow your vaccination schedule or else they won't entertain you. The best course of action is for your group to register at the same time.

The pattern for NCR based on the graph: we're okay-> rising cases-> goes back to we're kinda okay-> then up to red alert on cases-> goes down a bit-> fuck, here we go again.    

If only the  decision makers have the bandwidth to comprehend the whole picture or maybe even have the mental acuity to appreciate the numbers and employ  the services of statisticians or data science professionals + epidemiologist (don't include Dr. Take a seat) to help create a better plan of action instead of relying on PNP's checkpoints to curb the infections.

The more accurate answer, the population being bigger in 2020 than in 2015, if you look at the ratio of cases to population that ratio would be higher for a smaller population.

An example: 

* average of 10 cases per 100,000 population: ADAR = 10
* average of 10 cases per 105,000 population: ADAR = 9.52",3,0,

That would mean that ADAR in the city is a higher than published and  a little lower in the provinces. Either way, since testing is at such a low level, real ADAR must be a lot higher than what we can derive from the DOH drop.

> If enough tests are done, the TPR should be around 5%

I know WHO says a sound level of TPR is 5%, I'm not aware that they say you should *ramp up your testing until TPR reaches 5%*. Do you have any links for that? TPR after all is an indicator for community spread, and just by ramping up testing you don't lower community spread. Or what am I getting wrong?",3,0,
Comment,p82e5t,TPR is WORSE at the Provincial level,wilsonchua,2021-08-20 23:48:27," You and I both agree that WHO says the sound level of TPR is 5%.  And yes, they never said tests should be ramped up until TPR reaches 5%. That is correct. Now we ask: would be better off if TPR is at/around 5%?

I'd say that is definitely a YES. And it WOULD lower/slow down community spread. (Because) When enough tests are conducted, the LGUs would stand a better chance of catching and isolating the mild/asymptomatic cases that would otherwise be spreading the infections further, whether knowingly or unknowingly. 

Granted the Philippines has limited resources, so increasing testing would be a huge investment. But in communities where the covid is just taking hold, LGUs might be able to do mass testing WITHOUT spending a lot. 

In Singapore, one way is to test the sewer line of condos/estates. In the Philippines, CHOs/PHOs could work with their municipal engineers to track the strategic sewer points that could help detect covid down to the level of blocks/barangays.",5,0,

5% may be too low for us to achieve with limited resources, but that would probably represent more accurately the COVID status. With 17k at 20+% TPR, i tend to think that there are many more (new) cases and we're not seeing the whole/accurate picture.

So‚Ä¶ FDAs statement basically said that will never happen till trials are bigger and better designed. As a result the company is in Brazil now with bigger trial. We will see I guess.

Edit to add‚Ä¶ BTW, the US trial only provided two doses (effect was mostly gone from system in 14 days is how it‚Äôs explained) but standard of care provided a full 28 days benefit.

August 14, 2021 

2.59M vials of Sinovac, AstraZeneca, and Sputnik V cleared by Customs NAIA 

The Bureau of Customs Port of NAIA on August 12 & 13, 2021, released a total of 2,590,800 Covid-19 vaccines, comprising of 2M doses of Sinovac, 575.8K of AstraZeneca, and 15K of Sputnik V vaccines, which were pre-cleared via the BOC-NAIA One Stop Shop prior to its arrival. 

The 2M doses arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2 via Philippine Airlines Flight PR359 at 7:00 PM on August 12. On the other hand, the Sputnik V & AstraZeneca shipments arrived yesterday via Qatar Airways Flight QR932 and China Airlines Flight CI701 respectively. All shipments were immediately loaded in reefer vans and were transported to the designated cold storage facility by the DOH, underguarded by the Customs-NAIA CoVax Task Force and other enforcement agencies. 

On August 11, 2021, the BOC also released 810,000 vaccines comprising of 710K Pfizer and 100K Hayat-Vax vaccines, the latest COVID-19 vaccine brand the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). 

As of date, more than 41 million COVID-19 Vaccines have been facilitated by the Bureau of Customs Port of NAIA since February 2021. Of which, 22.5M are Sinovac, 7.85M are AstraZeneca, 3.24M are Johnson & Johnson, 3.81M are Pfizer, 3.83M are Moderna, 365K are Sputnik V, and the remaining 100K are Hayat-Vax jabs. 

More than 15 million vaccines are also set to arrive in the coming weeks and months for the country. 

The Bureau of Customs, thru the guidance and directives of Commissioner Rey Leonardo B. Guerrero, and the Port of NAIA headed by District Collector Carmelita M. Talusan, ensures the overall preparedness of the BOC in handling these time - sensitive¬† importations in this time of crisis, including PPE and other medical supplies. 

Moreover, the bureau remains steadfast in its mandate to ensure the unhampered delivery of its services, and will continue to share the Port's best practices in handling the time-sensitive COVID-19 Vaccine importations in interagency conferences and forums to contribute to the national vaccination program of the Philippine government.

|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Aggregate (best est.)|**March 11, 2022**|\-2 days|Computed based on the assumption that the 140 million doses will be used for exactly 70 million people. This is what you normally see in vaccine trackers when they say the approximate date of herd immunity.|
|Partial (one of two doses\*)|**February 21, 2022**|\-32 days|Computed based on how many doses are being administered as first doses.|
|Full (two of two doses\*)|**April 1, 2022**|\+28 days|Computed based on how many doses are being administered as second doses.|

Notes:

\* -  All COVID-19 vaccines that have been given Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration require two doses for every person, with the exception of the Janssen vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, which only requires one dose. The EUA for the Sputnik V vaccine from Gamaleya may be amended to be a one-dose vaccine (with pending documents and trial results).

\^ - Estimated dates are computed based on the 7-day moving averages of the vaccine rollout (doses administered per day). Computation will be greatly affected by the availability of data coming from the national government by the National Vaccination Operations Center (NVOC). Margin of error at +/- 1 day due to rounding.

\+ - A positive change indicates that the vaccine rollout is getting slower; a negative change indicates that the vaccine rollout is picking up pace.

\---

There will be instances wherein the estimated date based on second doses is earlier/faster than that on first doses. It can be possible if the 7-day moving average of administering second doses is faster than the rate of inoculating first doses. If the overall vaccination rates (from the start of the vaccine rollout on March 1, 2021) are used, the estimated herd immunity rates are as follows:

The efficacy of the vaccines affects how fast/slow the variants of concern can spread and how much of the population should be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity. The estimated date for herd immunity is only dependent on the target number of individuals to be vaccinated and the vaccination rollout rate.

As for the efficacy of CoronaVac against the delta variant, the company manufacturer (Sinovac) has not released any data. They are only saying that the vaccine is ""still effective"" against the delta variant but we cannot rely solely on word of mouth. The figure in the last infoboard for CoronaVac is only a conservative estimate based on how the delta variant reduced the efficacies of other vaccines. We will change it as soon as the data gets released.

The figures in the last infoboard include the efficacies of the vaccines against symptomatic infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The efficacies of the vaccines against hospitalizations and/or getting severe/critical conditions are even higher. But the infoboard is focused on how vaccine efficacies and the percentage of fully vaccinated individuals can slow the spread of the virus, hence the usage of those values.",5,0,

separate question, if you don't mind.  slide 1 shows 26M vaccine doses administered, broken down into 14M partial and 12M full.  if most of the full vaccinations require 2 doses (except J&J), then wouldn't that imply ~38M vaccine doses administered?  or is 1 dose = 2 shots for Sino, Moderna, Pfizer, etc?

This is why we still need to practice public minimum health standards even if the majority of people are already vaccinated.

As for the separate question, there are 14.1 million people who got at least the first dose of a two-dose vaccine. 12 million out of the 14.1 million people who got the first dose also got the second dose, hence the total is at around 26 million. It should be noted however that those who were inoculated with the Janssen vaccine are counted as fully vaccinated individuals. They are already included in the 2nd dose count. Based on the latest report by the Food and Drug Administration last August 8, 3.04 million Janssen vaccines have been administered. Subtracting this figure from the 11.39 million people who are fully vaccinated on the same date as the report, we can deduce that 8.35 million people got their 2nd dose of a two-dose vaccine, or around 63.83% of those who got the first dose of the two-dose vaccine.

Breakdown as of August 8, 2021:

August 12, 2021 

BOC clears 810K Pfizer-BioNTech and Hayat-Vax COVID-19 vaccines 

In the bid to support the country‚Äôs immunization campaign against COVID-19, the Bureau of Customs (BOC), through the Port of NAIA, facilitated the prompt release of 710,190 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccines for the Department of Health (DOH) on August 11, 2021. 

The 10th batch of Pfizer-BioNTech shipment, which was pre-cleared on August 10 through the BOC-NAIA COVID-19 One-Stop-Shop, arrived at NAIA Terminal 3 around 9:20 PM on August 11 from Belgium via Flight No. LD457. 

Earlier on August 11, around 1:55 PM, the first batch of Hayat Vax; an UAE-produced version of the Sinopharm vaccine, consisting of 100,000 doses, arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) via Flight No. EY0424. 

The Hayat-Vax COVID-19 vaccine was granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 11, 2021, adding to the more than 15 million doses of vaccines expected to arrive in the coming weeks. 

The said vaccines were immediately transported and underguarded upon arrival to Pharmaserv Cold Storage Facility and Southern Philippines Medical Center-Davao. To date, the BOC has cleared seven vaccine brands which includes Sinovac from China, AstraZeneca from UK, Sputnik V-Gamaleya from Russia, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna from US, Johnson and Johnson from Europe, and Hayat-Vax from UAE. 

With the arrival of more vaccine brands, BOC under the leadership of Commissioner Rey Leonardo B. Guerrero, and the Port of NAIA, headed by District Collector Carmelita M. Talusan continue to ensure that vaccine shipments are given priority and expedited clearance to support the government in ramping up its national inoculation program as it gears towards the nation‚Äôs recovery.

Post,p2fqpr,"My tita thinks getting vaccinated is a demonic act, how do I tell her to stop brain washing other people?",minatemana,2021-08-11 15:49:01,"**SEMI-LENGTHY POST BELOW**

Just as said in the title, my **tita genuinely thinks getting yourself vaccinated is an act against god and is considered to be a ""demonic"" act.** Not only is this thinking problematic, but what's worse is that she goes around telling all of her friends and relatives this idiotic belief of hers. I honestly have been trying to tolerate her way of thinking, but the moment I knew that she's **been brain washing other people not to take the vaccine** is when I instantly snapped.

The victims of her crime have been my grandparents, their house workers, farm workers, and close relatives. To emphasize the issue furthermore, these people **go in and out of my grandparents' house, and also interact with outside people the most**. Given the nature of their work and how constant their interactions with my grandparents are, the probability of the workers getting the virus and passing them is quite high. My parents and other vaxx believer relatives tried to warn the brain washed victims to no avail.

Alas, my grandparents suddenly felt the symptoms of the virus and are now being quarantined. One of them is confirmed to have pneumonia and the other is feeling faint. I'm genuinely worried for them as not only have they been in a **constant delicate state since way before, but they're also in their 90s**. I'm also livid as to how all of this could have been prevented, if my tita had just stopped spewing lies out of her mouth. I couldn't bear to blame my grandparents as with old age i do understand that they do get a little '**praning**'. But I guess it was also our (vaxx believer relatives) fault for not aggressively pushing my grandparents to be vaccinated.

I believe since we all have been exposed to the virus, we inevitably have to be quarantined. The only difference is that my whole family (including our house helpers) has been fully vaccinated, and the anti-vaxxer tita and her innocent victims aren't. To put a stop to this butterfly effect, **how do I convince them that being vaccinated isn't a demonic act? how do I tell them that this could save their lives? Even a legit doctor couldn't convince my tita and grandparents. Please help!!!!**",13,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus_PH/comments/p2fqpr/my_tita_thinks_getting_vaccinated_is_a_demonic/

Try hitting them with the : 


Do No Harm

[Job 8-10]
¬†[Acts 8:26-40]

Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. ‚Äî


Many consider the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates as the father of Western medicine. He understood the importance of following moral principles in the practice of medicine, and is credited with writing the Hippocratic Oath, which still serves as an ethical guide for today‚Äôs medical doctors. One key concept of the oath is ‚Äúto do no harm.‚Äù It implies that a physician will do only what he thinks will benefit his patients.

The principle of doing no harm extends to our relationships with others in everyday life. In fact, benevolence is central to New Testament teaching about loving others. In reflecting on the law of God, Paul sees that love is the intent behind many biblical commands: ‚ÄúLove does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law""

Each day as we follow Jesus Christ our Savior, **we are faced with choices that will affect the lives of others. When we choose a course of action, we should ask ourselves, ‚ÄúDoes this reflect Christ‚Äôs concern for others, or am I only concerned for myself?‚Äù** Such a sensitivity demonstrates the love of Christ that seeks to heal the broken and help those in need.

Post,p1ib6p,"How to know if somebody has recovered or if you're on the ""safe side"" of Covid recovery.?",DeathToIngsoc,2021-08-10 04:46:52,"I haven't been to a testing center yet but I'm self isolating myself in my room. I live alone in my apartment.

So here's the progression of my assumed Covid symptoms:

On first day, I got a pain in my left leg when I stood up from the bed, more like a lose ligament that made it feel weak. It has been a sunny and windy day so I walked outside and went up and down the hills but looks like I forced myself so the fatigue was really bad. Once I got home it suddenly felt like the start of a flu. The hours that followed I'm officially sick and had to rest.

Day 2: War in the stomach, it feels like diarrhea but not much liquid. I drank lots of water but I just urinate minutes after. There are body aches in random spots on my body.

Day 3: Almost the same as Day 2. Feeling great when sunlight and wind enters my window but feeling really sick at night.

Day 4: I lost my smell and taste, I never lost my appetite so far. There's also that something in the throat that you always try to scratch by coughing. Sometimes I get phlegm when I vape but that's it. The diarrhea is gone now but noticed a delay in bowel movement since I eat a lot these days and the volume of stool doesn't match it when it happens.

Day 5: Feeling good but hands trembles a bit due to weakness. I don't feel sick at night anymore no matter how cold the weather is. Something I noticed, there's this so called Covid tongue but I suspect it was the whole pack of strepsils that I've been finishing off for the day. It feels like there's a thin film on the top of my tongue and a bit of minty feel (not taste).

Day 6: This is now. Same as Day 5, smell and taste still missing. Still have that thing in my throat that I'd like to cough out. My anxiety is attacking so shortness of breath but I'm able to fix it by breathing through my mask. Once anxiety subsides breathing seems free as normal.

Comment,p1ib6p,"How to know if somebody has recovered or if you're on the ""safe side"" of Covid recovery.?",TheShpii,2021-08-10 08:40:55,"The only reply to this is GET TESTED! It would be a great help if you can avail of the home service swab tests by private labs, para di ka na lalabas ng bahay to avoid further exposure. If not, report to your Baranggay Health Emergency Response Team (BHERT), so you can inform them of your symptoms and so they can monitor you and schedule your tests. Para rin mabigyan ka ng Baranggay Health Workers ng meds na kakailanganin mo for your symptoms while waiting for results.

Mahirap magbase sa symptoms kasi it might be just your regular flu or, wag naman sana, COVID na nga. Kailangan mo na ring ma-test, for your peace of mind na rin.

Side story lang: Na-infect ang family ko last April 2020. In denial lahat kami sa symptoms ng kapatid ko nun, kasi sabi namin ""ah, usual trangkaso lang yan."" So hindi kami nagpa-test. Until eventually tinamaan ang tatay ko, nanay ko, pati ako. Unfortunately, di naka-survive ang nanay ko. Nakapagpa-test lang kami nung wala na siya, since considered kami as ""close contacts."" So ayun, please get tested! May symptoms ka na, hinog ka na.

Since you're symptomatic, ang protocol pa rin kasi is you're considered ""recovered"" pag wala ka nang symptoms after 14 days of isolation. Standard yan. Sa asymptomatic lang ata ang 10 days isolation, correct me if I'm wrong.",11,0,

Fully vaccinated persons now make >10% of the Philippines' population. Est. dates for herd immunity (70M people) in the comment section.,edg19,2021-08-09 06:05:13,"Estimate date for achieving herd immunity (70 million people):

|Type|Estimate Date\^|Change from prev. update^(+)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Aggregate (best est.)|**March 14, 2022**|\-32 days|Computed based on the assumption that the 140 million doses will be used for exactly 70 million people. This is what you normally see in vaccine trackers when they say the approximate date of herd immunity.|
|Partial (one of two doses\*)|**May 16, 2022**|\-153 days|Computed based on how many doses are being administered as first doses.|
|Full (two of two doses\*)|**February 4, 2022**|\+1 day|Computed based on how many doses are being administered as second doses.|

Notes:

\* -  All COVID-19 vaccines that have been given Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration require two doses for every person, with the exception of the Janssen vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, which only requires one dose. The EUA for the Sputnik V vaccine from Gamaleya may be amended to be a one-dose vaccine (with pending documents and trial results).

\^ - Estimated dates are computed based on the 7-day moving averages of the vaccine rollout (doses administered per day). Computation will be greatly affected by the availability of data coming from the national government by the National Vaccination Operations Center (NVOC). Margin of error at +/- 1 day due to rounding.

\+ - A positive change indicates that the vaccine rollout is getting slower; a negative change indicates that the vaccine rollout is picking up pace.

\---

There will be instances wherein the estimated date based on second doses is earlier/faster than that on first doses. It can be possible if the 7-day moving average of administering second doses is faster than the rate of inoculating first doses. If the overall vaccination rates (from the start of the vaccine rollout on March 1, 2021) are used, the estimated herd immunity rates are as follows:

Also the regions are now (more or less accurately) sorted from North to South.

ADAR, the ""average daily attack rate"", is defined as the average number of new cases in the past 14 days per 100,000 population. The ADAR was calculated for each day since March 30, 2020, and then visualized. Yellow in this picture represents an ADAR of 7, which is where most countries start to put restrictions in place in order to stop exponential growth.

An ADAR below 7 usually means no restrictions necessary. So green is from zero going to yellow (=7), going to red when higher than 7.

The thickness of the bars represent the population of the region or subregion. I.e. the whole height of the picture represents 109M people.

The reason why some viruses evolve like that is because being less deadly affords them more time to spread and transmit to as many people as possible. They can‚Äôt spread if they kill their host right away. Right now, sars-cov-2 doesn‚Äôt get an evolutionary advantage if it becomes less deadly since most of its transmission happens through pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers and death happens 28 days later on average ‚Äî way beyond the window of opportunity to trasmit.

Instead of focusing on variants of concern, we should also look into people of concern.   
Another view to look at the current delta variant is that the population of people getting infected is different compared to the earlier cases. So it is not surprising that other symptoms are observed.

The EUA for the Sputnik V vaccine from Gamaleya may be amended to be a one-dose vaccine (with pending documents and trial results).

\^ - Estimated dates are computed based on the 7-day moving averages of the vaccine rollout (doses administered per day). Computation will be greatly affected by the availability of data coming from the national government by the National Vaccination Operations Center (NVOC). Margin of error at +/- 1 day due to rounding.

\+ - A positive change indicates that the vaccine rollout is getting slower; a negative change indicates that the vaccine rollout is picking up pace.

There will be instances wherein the estimated date based on second doses is earlier/faster than that on first doses. It can be possible if the 7-day moving average of administering second doses is faster than the rate of inoculating first doses.

August 04, 2021 

3 Million Moderna Vaccines cleared by Customs NAIA 

The Bureau of Customs - Port of NAIA facilitated the release of the 3rd batch of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, consisting of 3,000,060 doses for the Department of Health (DOH) on August 03, 2021. 

The shipment arrived from the United States of America (USA) via Flight No. QR928 in NAIA Terminal 3 at around 4:10 pm and was pre-cleared on August 2 via the BOC-NAIA COVID-19 One-Stop-Shop. Upon arrival, the vaccines were underguarded until delivery at Pharmaserv Cold Storage Facility, the designated DOH Cold Storage Facility. 

The immediate facilitation of essential goods such as COVID-19 Vaccines is part of the Bureau of Customs‚Äô support to the vaccination program of the national government. To date, more than 37 million vaccines have already been facilitated by the BOC. Of which, 19.5M are Sinovac, 7.7M are Astrazeneca, 3M are J&J, 350K are Sputnik V, 3M are Pfizer, and 3.5M are Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. 

About 17 million more Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are anticipated to arrive in the coming weeks and months under the tripartite supply agreement with Moderna, Inc., which the Philippines signed into last March this year. 

In furtherance of the nation‚Äôs quest against COVID-19, the BOC through the leadership of Commissioner Guerrero, and the Port of NAIA, headed by Collector Talusan, in partnership with DOH and IATF, also conducted COVID-19 Vaccination Programs last June 19 & 25, and July 17, 2021. The bureau will continue to work 24/7 to ensure the expeditious facilitation of COVID-19 vaccine shipments for the country.

I guess that should be updated more in the coming days/weeks.

1.	The delta variant has pushed some herd immunity levels of protection forecasts and projections to beyond 80% based on some studies, as well as due to additions of some factors of safety.
2.	The % of population eligible for the vaccine is only 69.7% based on 2020 projections. Ages 0 to 14, currently ineligible for the vaccine total around 33M. We literally need  all the adult population and those 12 to 18 years old to be 100% vaccinated just to reach the current target of 70%. That‚Äôs impossible.
3.	70M people is around 63.7% of the total population. In terms of % of total population currently eligible for the vaccine, that‚Äôs 91.34%. So 9 out 10 people eligible for the vaccine should get vaccinated to achieve this. That‚Äôs very difficult.

I think we should adjust the tables to include possible projections and changes. Hopefully, a vaccine will be developed for those below 12 to further increase the chances of actually achieving some form of immunity.",6,0,

Around 4:25 P.M., Flight No. EK332 containing the seventh (7th) batch of AstraZeneca arrived at Terminal 3 - Bay 114 of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA). Upon arrival, the vaccines were immediately underguarded until delivered to Pharmaserv Cold Storage Facility. 

The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and¬† University of Oxford, is the second COVID-19 vaccine that has been issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It wa also the second COVID-19 vaccine imported into the country comprising of 487,000 doses last March 4. It followed the first COVID-19 vaccine arrival in the Philippines on February 28, 2021. To date, 7,273,940 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines have already been cleared by the Bureau since March. 

As the country continues to battle the current health crisis, BOC-NAIA headed by District Collector Carmelita Talusan will continue to diligently uphold the mandate of the Bureau of Customs under the direction of Commissioner Rey Leonardo B. Guerrero to expeditiously facilitate the clearance and release of time-sensitive COVID-19 vaccine shipments as part of its contribution to the country‚Äôs immunization campaign against COVID-19.

But since we worked in an essential industry (basic services, not healthcare) we were able to get vaccinated with sinovac via LGU early on.

Now that the Delta variant is becoming prominent (with Sinovac not being that effective against it) and the Moderna ordered by our company now available by September. We are thinking of getting vaccinated again with the more effective Moderna as we have two slots allocated to us.

However we can't help but feel like we are hoarding the vaccine since a lot of people have not been vaccinated yet? On the other hand we have not stopped coming to the office ever since the pandemic started since we are in an essential industry and the risk is real there have been COVID outbreaks within the office that we've just dealt with. We are worried because my uncle who was vaccinated with Astra Zeneca still caught the delta variant and still had a hard time recovering.

Would it be prudent that we get vaccinated again as booster? Or give our Moderna slots to others? Thoughts?",4,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus_PH/comments/owls28/is_it_hoarding_with_extra_steps_to_get_a/

the best thing to do give your slots to others.
th smart thing to do is to protect yourself

i myself have reservations for the efficacy of sinovac - however upon researching the meaning of efficacy -and to protect my elderly mom i signed up for sinovac. (see the vox on YouTube it helps)

getting vaccinated is not or would it ever equate to ""no covid"" it just means the fatality rate will go down significantly.

washing of hands, sanitation, social distancing, are the best answer to covid

Using the formula na nakalagay sa last infoboard, lalabas na 169% ng population ng Pilipinas ang kailangang bakunahan. We are now using the Delta variant as a reference. What it means is kahit na bakunahan mo ang buong populasyon ng Pilipinas, it will not be enough to reach herd immunity.

However, yung resulting figure na 169% is just theoretical. It will change (go lower or even higher) if any of the following changes:

* reproduction number ng Delta variant - malaki ang range for this (from 4 to 8); we use 6 as a conservative estimate (bilang median na rin)
* composition ng vaccine supply sa Pilipinas - one may dumating na mga bagong batch na bakuna, magbabago rin ang percent composition ng bawat brand ng bakuna sa vaccine supply sa bansa
* efficacy ng bakuna kontra Delta variant - as of now, ongoing pa rin ang trials (lab and/or real-world) sa mga bakuna kontra Delta variant; so far, yung mga may mga published efficacy rates na ang ibang mga bakuna, however, yung sa CoronaVac at Sputnik V ay wala pa, kaya naglagay lang kami ng conservative estimates for them (we rely on the numbers, hindi doon sa sasabihing ""effective pa rin"" ang bakuna without showing any evidence or figures from trials)

Pero kahit na ganyan ang naging resulta sa paggamit ng formula for herd immunity, we still advise everyone to be vaccinated once it's your turn. Hindi lang naman ang Delta variant ang kumakalat sa Pilipinas ngayon. It will still give you some protection one way or another, especially from getting severe or critical conditions after getting COVID-19.",7,0,

July 29, 2021 

2.5M Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines pre-cleared by Customs NAIA 

Two different batches of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines comprising a total of 2.5 million doses were pre-cleared by the Bureau of Customs, through the Port of NAIA, from July 29 to 30, 2021. 

Today, July 29, a total of 1,500,000 Sinovac vaccines took its landing at the NAIA Terminal 3 at around 7:30AM aboard Flight No. 5J 671. On July 30, another batch of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines are expected to arrive at the same terminal consisting of a total of 1,000,000 doses. 

With the direction of Commissioner Rey Leonardo B. Guerrero to ensure that vaccine shipments are given priority and expedited clearance, prior to the arrivals, the shipments were pre-cleared on July 28, 2021 at the BOC-NAIA COVID-19 One-Stop-Shop upon submission by the Department of Health of all pertinent documents as the consignee. 

Since February 2021, more than 30M doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been cleared and released by the Bureau of Customs. 16M of which are Sinovac, 6.8M are AstraZeneca, 350K are Sputnik V, 3.4M are Pfizer, 500K are Moderna, and 3.2M are Johnson & Johnson brand. 

Amid the increasing threat of national health crisis brought about by new virus variants, the Bureau of Customs, through the Port of NAIA headed by District Collector Carmelita Talusan, remains committed in facilitating the prompt release of COVID-19 vaccine shipments, as part of its support to the government's national vaccination program and to the recovery of the nation from the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic.

The numbers regarding the Delta variant cases in the Philippines only come from announcements being released by the Department of Health (DOH). In fact, the information that only gets released to the public is just the overall increase (in this case, the +55 cases).

Certain members of the media are being given the press release from the DOH which contains the detailed information about the new cases (on where are they located, and what are their status/es), that are not being directly released to the public. It's up to those media personnel to release them to the public.

3% vaccination in 2 months is too slow, at that rate it will take 5 years! Even 2 years is too long, because of the high probability of at least 3 more dangerous variants which may prove immune to the current vaccines. 

The other factors include infection and loss of doctors and nurses, lack of testing and tracking, lack of oxygen and ventilators, lack of long term supply for PPE. 

STOP THE SPREAD NOW. Fight COVID-19 like a brush fire, build firebreaks: deep vaccination zones around critical infrastructure, airports, power stations, hospitals, schools, government facilities, critical employment and economic sectors that support the tax base, call centers, banking, telecommunications, pharma, farming, transportation, mass transit, military.

Comment,og8xmp,A recent drop in Death Rate. Great news! Looking for an underlying reason.,ane20,2021-07-08 15:15:11,"I've been using case data published with data drop from [DOH.gov.ph](https://doh.gov.ph/covid19tracker) to monitor a 7-day moving average death rate.  This is using deaths that occur 14 days after being identified with COVID and getting a ratio (Deaths in 14 days / New cases on date). For example, Deaths occurring on 6-15 / All New Cases on 6-1.  The idea is that this ratio helps to identify how well covid was treated for each collective group of cases identified on a date in case there is a spike or decline impacting the available standard of care.  There have been spikes (when infrastructure was stressed) and there have been declines (with increases in testing in March and April identifying more mild/moderate cases) all IMO as to why. 

BUT... Recently, there has been a recent dramatic drop and I have a theory but curious if anyone knows of changes.  New cases identified around 5/23 and prior have a 7-day moving average of right at 2%.  7 Day average drops to 1.4% by 6/1.  Even as data has been updated recently the drop in death rate has remained although the trend line has moved around.  Since this is using deaths that occurred in June any newer data is riskier but further drops are indicating even lower death rates into June.  That probably goes up a little as data is updated, but very favorable.  

So, I'm looking for changes in standard of care or other factors that started around the 1st of June.  (Very Late May to very early June) these would be a sign that death counts were avoided in June due to changes.  Any ideas why?",6,0,

If it was Vaccine alone there would have been a sizable and immediate drops in US. I‚Äôll check US again when I can but I don‚Äôt think I saw that type of drop earlier this year when I reviewed or even recently and they are now approaching 70%. The case data published by PH is really better than totals data available by US. The totals per day I‚Äôve used in US could be deaths or new cases from weeks prior getting cleaned up. So, not as reliable as PH because data identifies death date and date identified. As PH cleans up data the average moves a little but remains accurately associated to the relevant date.  Regardless I think even in US cases dropped  and total deaths dropped but the percentage is my focus as I‚Äôm looking for improvement other than infrastructure improvement (overwhelmed hospitals) to help flag a better SOC type change.",3,0,
Comment,og8xmp,A recent drop in Death Rate. Great news! Looking for an underlying reason.,ane20,2021-07-09 01:19:01,"I said I would check US data. BTW, I thought vaccine rates were closer to 70% but still very high obviously.  I'm using the data set below. It is different than PH's data because it includes the counts reported every day of new cases and deaths.  The case level data offered (that I see) does not have the death date AND the identified date for each case record to get the ratio I'm monitoring.  That said, US States MIGHT be cleaning up reported deaths or anything could be the reason but the US death rate is climbing.  NOT the Total but instead the percentage.  BUT, I wouldn't assume too much because it is probably just new data but deaths from past skewing results or something else (delta variant or ???).  Regardless, looking at that data plus considering the total death rates between both countries I still don't think the Vaccine is the reason for the death rate percentage improvement recently in the Philippines.

Para sa akin, the Philippine is not yet at ""low-risk"" sa COVID-19, taliwas sa self-assessment ng government. Their only basis on classifying the Philippines as low-risk ay ang national two-week growth rate (TWGR) na nasa negative nine percent. DOH should not rejoice on that number alone kasi there are some looming figures na kailangan nilang tingnan nang maayos:

&#x200B;

* There are regions that are considered as high-risk.

DOH na mismo ang nagsabi na merong mga rehiyon sa bansa na pataas pa rin ang kaso sa kanilang lugar, tulad ng Western at Eastern Visayas, Davao Region, at SOCCSKSARGEN. You cannot just declare na ang kalagayan ng bansa ay bumubuti kung sa ibang parte nito ay lumalala. Also, NCR is is seeing an increasing trend sa cases.

&#x200B;

* The average number of added cases per day is still very high.

As you have said, nasa range ng 4k to 6k ang daily added cases, which is not good. That should go lower. That is alarming, dahil na-manage natin na mas mababa pa sa average ngayon yung nakuha natin noon.

&#x200B;

* The positivity rate is still high.

The recommended case positivity rate ng WHO is at most 5%. We are recording positivity rates of more than 10% for 115 days now (nag-start s'ya noong March 9, 2021 pa). That's bad.

&#x200B;

* We are not testing enough.

The number of tests and individuals being tested is not peaking, meaning hindi tumataas ang bilang ng nate-test kahit na dumadami ang bilang ng mga laboratoryo na kayang mag-test ng RT-PCR samples. We have only tested an average of 47.7k individuals per day noong June, compared from 50.6k per day noong April.

&#x200B;

* We do not have the capacity to test for variants.

So far, the UP-Philippine Genome Center is doing a great job in testing samples for variants, but their ability to test the samples is greatly hindered by the lack of supply ng reagents na kailangan to test them. Kaya wala halos balita about variants, at kung saan nanggaling yung tests ng mga kaso na positive for variants.

&#x200B;

* We are not ready for the Delta variant.

What we have practiced so far from the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and the succeeding variants (Alpha and Beta) will not be effective anymore for the Delta variant. Delta variant is more than 50% more transmissible sa Alpha variant, which was more than 60% more transmissible sa original SARS-CoV-2 strain. Those who have caught the Delta variant will have at much as two times the risk of getting hospitalized kaysa sa ibang variants. Kahit fully vaccinated na ang tao ay kailangan pa ring gumamit ng mask dahil sa Delta variant. The current infrastructures and protocols in place sa bansa will not be enough once na nakapasok at magkaroon na ng local at community transmission ang Delta variant sa Pilipinas.

Look at what's happening in Indonesia. They are reaching record highs in cases and deaths today dahil sa Delta variant. Kung mangyayari 'yan sa Pilipinas ngayon, our situation will be similar as theirs, if not worse.

&#x200B;

* We are not vaccinating enough.

Only 7% ng mga tao sa Pilipinas ang nabakunahan ng 1st dose. Only 2% ang fully vaccinated (2 doses na). The supply is still inadequate (not enough), and yet they're still pushing to open up the economy. We should not aim to ""dance with COVID."" We should aim for Zero COVID.

Post,o0z0z1,(NOTICE) Clarification Regarding Inconsistencies in Reports on Acquired Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccines,edg19,2021-06-16 07:11:36,"We have reported on the [Vaccine Statistics thread for June 14, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus_PH/comments/o0axgh/vaccine_statistics_as_of_061421_the_total_number/), that the vaccine supply doses have decreased due to the inconsistencies in reports of the acquired Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. The number of doses in question was the one that was delivered to the Philippines on Thursday, June 10.

Based on the initial reports on June 10, the number of delivered Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines was at [2,279,160 doses](https://www.rappler.com/nation/philippines-receives-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-doses-june-10-2021). However, according to the released report of the United States Embassy in the Philippines on the same day, the number of arrived vaccines was at [2,282,850 doses](https://ph.usembassy.gov/over-2-million-us-supported-pfizer-biontech-vaccines-arrive-in-cebu-davao-and-manila/). A few days after, Vaccine Czar Sec. Carlito Galvez, Jr. in a senate committee hearing last June 15, told that the actual number of vaccines that were delivered was [2,276,820 doses](https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/status/1404628378649468931) (which were added to the 193,050 doses delivered last May 10, 2021, to make a total of 2,479,870 doses).

Due to the inconsistencies in the number of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that were delivered on June 10, we have decided to follow the tally released by the vaccine czar in order not to divert from the official tally of the national government. We previously followed the initial reports released by the national government of 2,279,160 doses in our Vaccine Statistics reports. We have replaced it with 2,276,820 doses following the vaccine czar's pronouncements.

We hope that this clarification will help everyone to understand how accurate information should be upheld at all times, and all inconsistencies must be corrected in order for us to have a transparent vaccine rollout in our country.

> When the pandemic happened to break out on the doorstep of the lab with the largest collection of coronaviruses in the world, fueling speculation that the WIV might be involved, Daszak and 26 other scientists signed a letter that appeared in The Lancet on February 19, 2020.

> By examining some metadata tags that had been accidentally uploaded by the WIV along with its genetic sequences for RaTG13, Ribera discovered that scientists at the lab had indeed been actively studying the virus in 2017 and 2018-they hadn&#039;t stuck it in a freezer and forgotten about it, after all.

> In the WIV&#039;s grant applications and awards, The Seeker found detailed descriptions of the Institute&#039;s research plans, and they were damning: Projects were underway to test the infectivity of novel SARS-like viruses they&#039;d discovered in human cells and in lab animals, to see how they might mutate as they crossed species, and to genetically recombine pieces of different viruses-all being done at woefully inadequate biosecurity levels.

Regardless if there‚Äôs a novel virus or not, you should never take antibiotics unless prescribed by a physician kasi incorrect use will lead to drug-resistant diseases.

They think that antibiotics are a cure all. But the thing is antibiotic immunity is a real thing if you don't use it properly or fail to finish the required doses. I fear that in the future that if they do need to take it that it won't be as effective.

I have tried to educate them against self medication but it's a tough process specially with their generation. I hope you have a better result than what I have.",5,0,

It is antibiotics that are to blame for this microbial crisis we now have by being the only one to propel the hyper-resistant bacteria that cause the excess mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is a collapse we are witnessing where antibiotics can no longer cure the deadly bacterial infections we see in the ICU, India, Wuhan, Syria, etc ...

My advice to your parents (who it is probably too late for as they already have a severely disturbed normal flora (own bacterial flora) due to the excessive use of antibiotics. My advice to everyone is to completely avoid antibiotics as you disturb your own normal flora by taking remove some types of bacteria but not those that have resistance.Bacteria act as opportunists so if a bacterium disappears the survivor takes over and resistance bacteria take over, the diversity of the normal flora decreases, you become more prone to infections by resistant bacteria. antibiotics (many cures and often) have a completely changed normal flora to normal and a sharp reduction in diversity among their own body bacteria both inside and outside, which gives those who overuse antibiotics (the longer, the worse) an initially greatly weakened immune system ,
JAA ... our own bacterial flora / normal flora is part of our own immune systemüò≥ and without it, people are very vulnerable to other infections like a respiratory virus like Covid-19. However, the Pan-resistant bacteria are now more present throughout the body, so in the future a scratch on the finger can lead to a life-threatening infection because subsequent bacterial infection cannot be treated. We can all be affected even with an intact normal flora, but the risk is much lower (probably very few with intact normal flora that died in Covid-19 e.g.

The problem is
ANTIBIOTICS.
If we stop using antibiotics, all the resistance ""Poff"" disappears overnight.

We need to develop new treatment for bacterial infections that do not disturb the normal flora.",1,0,
